[FINN]
You say yes, I say no

[FINN & RACHEL]
You say stop, and I say go, go, go
Oh, no
You say goodbye, and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

I say high, you say low
You say why, and I say I don't know
Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello (Hello)
Hello, hello (Hello)
I don't know why you say goodbye (Hello), I say hello (Hello)
Hello, hello (Hello)
I don't know why you say goodbye (Hello), I say hello

Why, why, why, why, why
Why do you say goodbye, goodbye?
Oh, no
You say goodbye, and I say hello
Hello, hello (Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye)
I don't know why you say goodbye (Hello, goodbye), I say hello
Hello, hello (Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye)
I don't know why you say goodbye (Hello, goodbye), I say hello

[FINN]
You say yes (I say yes), I say no (But I may mean no)

[FINN & RACHEL]
You say stop (I can stay), but I say go, go, go ('Til it's time to go)
Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello (Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye)
I don't know why you say goodbye (Hello, goodbye), I say hello
(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye) Hello, hello (Hello, hello)
I don't know why you say goodbye (Hello, goodbye), I say hello
Hello, hello (Hello, hello)
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello-o-o
