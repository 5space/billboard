[Intro]
Gassed up, yeah, yeah
Hey, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, hey

[Verse 1]
Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us?
There's nothin' between us, oh-oh-oh, ayy, ayy
Why would you wanna use a life to keep us?
To keep us together, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Better when we're both apart (Oh)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other
No good for each other
Better when we're both apart (My baby)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

[Chorus]
A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh
It was the only time
And if I led you on, then I apologize

[Verse 2]
How can I make you rethink your decision?
Unruly decision, oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Hey, what's gonna make you rethink your position?
I know your intentions (I know your intentions), oh-oh-oh, oh, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Better when we're both apart (Oh)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other (Each other)
No good for each other (No good for each other)
Better when we're both apart (My baby)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh-oh (Woah)
It was the only time
And if I led you on, then I apologize, oh

Better when we're both apart (Baby)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other
No good for each other
Better when we're both apart (Oh, baby)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, hey

Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, oh, ho-oh

A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh (Hey)
It was the only time (It was the only time)
And if I led you on, then I apologize, oh (Apologize, woah)

Baby, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, ayy
