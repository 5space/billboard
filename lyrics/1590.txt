[BLAINE & (THE WARBLERS)]
At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't ever been
But now you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask (Mmmm) to use my car (Car)
Drive it all day (Mmmm) and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity (Mmmm)
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold (Mmmm) some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You trifling (-Ling) good for nothing type of brother
Silly me! (Me) Why haven't I found another?
A baller when times get hard I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So you and me are through

[BLAINE & (THE WARBLERS)]
Now you've been (Mmmm) maxing out my card (Card)
Gave me bad credit (Mmmm), buyin' me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid (Mmmm) the first bill
But instead you're headin' to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees perpetrating (Mmmm)
Telling your friends that you be ballin'

And then you (Mmmm) use my cell phone (Phone)
Callin' whoever (Mmmm) that you think's at home
And then when the bill comes (Mmmm)
All of a sudden you be acting dumb
Don't know where none of these calls (Mmmm) come from
When your momma's number's here more than once

You trifling (-Ling) good for nothing type of brother
Silly me! (Me) Why haven't I found another?
A baller when times get hard I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So you and me are through

You triflin' good for nothing type of brother
Oh silly me why haven't I found another
You triflin' good for nothing type of brother
Oh silly me why haven't I found another

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?

[BLAINE]
(Pay my telephone, telephone bills)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So you and me are through

[(BLAINE) & THE WARBLERS]
Can you pay my bills? (Ohh noo)
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Can you pay my bills)
If you did then maybe we could chill

[BLAINE & THE WARBLERS]
I don't think you do (No, no)
So you and me are through
