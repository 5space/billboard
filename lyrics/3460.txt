[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
You miss me?
I miss all of y'all
All of you girls standin' together like that
I can't take it

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Wait a minute
Women, I can do anything you like
I can do anything you need
And I got a better body
Than the magazines you read
None of them boys know the first thing
About your fantasy
And if they tried, they cannot do it
Just like me

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell and Miley Cyrus]
I know you certainly been gone
And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams and Miley Cyrus, w/ Tory Kelly]
Come get it bae, come get it bae
Come get it bae, come get it bae
You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high to
Take it easy on the clutch, cause girl I like you
Wait a minute(Hey)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
I can see it the way you like
I can do anything you need
I can give you dirty looks
Like them niggas that's on TV

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
None of them boys know the first thing
About your fantasy
And if they tried, they cannot do it
Just like me

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus and Pharrell Williams]
I know you certainly been gone
And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams and Miley Cyrus, w/ Tory Kelly]
Come get it bae, come get it bae
Come get it bae, come get it bae
You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high to
Take it easy on the clutch, cause girl I like you, hey

[Bridge A: Miley Cyrus, Tori Kelly & Pharrell Williams]
There comes a time, comes a time
The craving will grab your wrist
You'll need a sugar fix, baby
There comes a time, comes a time
And you won't believe what you'll do
When that sugar's callin' you

[Bridge B: Pharrell Williams]
Girl, there will come a time (Sugar, sugar), this is where you wanna be
H-O-M-E (Sugar, sugar), satisfaction guaranteed
And now it's comes your time (Sugar, sugar), this is where you wanna be
Cause everything you need (Sugar, sugar), you will only find in me

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams and Miley Cyrus, w/ Tory Kelly]
Come get it bae, come get it bae
Come get it bae, come get it bae
Come get it bae, come get it bae
Come get it bae, come get it bae
You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high to
Take it easy on the clutch, cause girl I like you, hey

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
