[Intro]
Cheyenne, Cheyenne

[Verse 1]
I'm a little unsure how it got so complicated
If I let go I know, I'll regret it
Every heart that I held before, I was sure to break it
I don't know what you did, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't stop thinking 'bout you every day
No, I can't stop now

[Chorus]
Look what we started, baby
You're not what I expected
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started, baby
I used to look for exits
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun

[Post-Chorus]
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove

[Verse 2]
Cheyenne, got the table set for two, guess you couldn't make it
Thought I kissed your lips again, I was dreaming (dreaming)
I still believe that night we shared was something sacred (yeah)
I'm tryna clear my head, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't (can't) stop (stop) thinking 'bout you every day
No, I can't (can't) stop now

[Chorus]
Look what we started, baby
You're not what I expected
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun (Cheyenne)
Look what we started, baby (started, baby)
I used to look for exits
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun

[Post-Chorus]
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove

[Bridge]
Cheyenne, Cheyenne
Cheyenne, Cheyenne

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't stop thinking 'bout you every day
No, I can't stop now

[Chorus]
Look what we started, baby (oh, oh, baby)
You're not what I expected (woo)
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun (huh, woo)
Look what we started, baby (started, baby)
I used to look for exits (you, yeah)
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun (oh, oh)

[Post-Chorus]
I never meant to fall in love (Cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love (Cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love (Cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love (Cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in lo-ove

[Outro]
