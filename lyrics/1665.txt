[FINN]
It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you

[RACHEL]
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you

[QUINN]
Well I know this little chapel
On the boulevard we can go
No one will know

[SAM]
Oh, come on, girl

[QUINN]
Who cares if we're trashed
Got a pocket full of cash

[SAM and QUINN]
We can blow
Shots of Patr√≥n
And it's on, girl

[ARTIE & BRITTANY]
Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go

[ARTIE]
If you're ready, like I'm ready

[TINA]
'Cause it's a beautiful night

[TINA with MIKE]
We're looking for something dumb to do

[TINA]
Hey baby

[TINA with MIKE]
I think I wanna marry you

[ARTIE & BRITTANY]
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you

[SAM]
Oh, I'll go get a ring

[QUINN]
Let the choir bells sing

[SAM and QUINN]
Like oooh...
So what you wanna do?

[SAM]
Let's just run, girl

[FINN]
If we wake up
And we wanna break up

[FINN and RACHEL]
That's cool
No, I won't blame you

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS]
It was fun, girl

[ARTIE and BRITTANY with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

[FINN and RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS]
'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you

[ARTIE and BRITTANY with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you

[SAM with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Just say I do

[FINN]
Tell me right now baby

[ARTIE]
Tell me right now baby

[SAM with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Just say I do

[ARTIE]
Tell me right now baby

[FINN]
Tell me right now baby, oh!

[RACHEL and FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS]
'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
