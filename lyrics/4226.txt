[Verse 1]
And though I never got her name
Or time to find out anything
I loved her just the same
And though I rode a different road
And sang a different song
I’ll love her till my last breaths gone

[Chorus 1]
Like a river made of silver
Everyone came running to the scene
I was shot down in cold blood
By an angel in blue jeans

[Verse 2]
Late that night she got away
I chased her to the turnpike
Then lost her where the music never plays
And though I rolled upon the stones and fell into the water
I’ll love her till my judgment day

[Chorus 2]
Like a sunrise made of white lies
Everything was nothing as it seems
I was shot down in cold blood
By an angel in blue jeans

[Bridge]
I hear voices calling all around
I keep falling down
I think my heart could pound right out of me
I see a million different ways
To never leave this maze alive

[Verse 3]
I woke up in somebody’s arms
Strange and so familiar
Where nothing could go wrong
Barely alive or nearly dead
Somehow awake in my own bed
And there you are

[Chorus 3]
Like a highway headed my way
Life is but a dream
I was shot down by your love
My angel in blue jeans
