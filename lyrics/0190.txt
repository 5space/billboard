[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

[Chorus: John Legend with Ariana Grande]
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast

[Bridge: Ariana Grande & John Legend, John Legend, Ariana Grande]
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh-oh
Hey
Yeah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ever just the same, oh
And ever a surprise, yeah
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande & John Legend]
Tale as old as time, a-a-ay
Tune as old as song, oh
Bitter-sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong, woah

[Chorus: Ariana Grande, John Legend, Both]
Certain as the sun
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

[Outro: Ariana Grande, John Legend, Both]
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Woah (A-a-ay)
Beauty and... (A-a-ay)
Beauty and the Beast
