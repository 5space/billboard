[Verse 1]
Seems like I was walkin' in the wrong direction
I barely recognize my own reflection, oh
Scared of love but scared of life alone

[Verse 2]
Seems I've been playin' on the safe side, baby
Buildin' walls around my heart to save me, oh
But it's time for me to let it go

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm ready to feel now
No longer am I 'fraid of the fall down
It must be time to move on now
Without the fear of how it might end
I guess I'm ready to love again

[Verse 3]
Just when you think that love will never find you
You run away, but still, it's right behind you, oh
It's just somethin' that we can't control

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm ready to feel now
No longer am I 'fraid of the fall down
It must be time to move on now
Without the fear of how it might end
I guess I'm ready to love again

[Bridge]
So come and find me
I'll be waitin' up for you
I'll be holdin' out for you tonight

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm ready to feel now
No longer am I 'fraid of the fall down
It must be time to move on now
Without the fear of how it might end
I guess I'm ready... ready to love again

[Outro]
Ooh, I'm ready to love again
