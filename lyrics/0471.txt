[Intro]
Here it go

[Verse 1]
Well, I won 2 dollars on a scratch-off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought 2 more with it
And I won 10 bucks and that was just right
So, I bought a six pack and a, a bag of ice

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got
It ain’t like we really need a million dollar yacht cause

[Chorus 1]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank

[Verse 2]
Still, can you imagine if we ever struck it
I’d go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we’d tell our bosses they can do the same
We’ll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We’d sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But till that dream comes true why don’t you grab your bikini cause

[Chorus 1]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank

[Bridge]
However it goes (whatever happens)
We’ve got it made (in these shades)
Cause baby we can float (behind this boat)
We can ride away

[Chorus 2]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day
We’re laughing all the way, to the river bank
