[MERCEDES, (SANTANA), {with SANTANA}, (KURT & SANTANA), (with KURT & SANTANA)]
There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of, ooh-ooh
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above, mmm

Oh, I lose control (Ooh-ooh)
Can't seem to {Get enough, uh huh}
When I wake from dreaming (Ooh-ooh)
Tell me is it (Really love, aha)

[RACHEL (KURT, MERCEDES, and SANTANA), {with KURT, MERCEDES, & SANTANA}]
(Ooh) How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I {know}
(Ooh) How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I {know}

[KURT, MERCEDES, RACHEL, & SANTANA (MERCEDES & SANTANA), {KURT & RACHEL}]
How will I know? (If he really loves me?)
I say a prayer (With every) heart beat
I fall in love (Whenever we meet)
I'm asking you ('Cause you know about these things)
How will I know? (If he's thinking of me?)
I try to phone (But I'm too shy) {Can't speak}
Falling in love (Is all bitter sweet)
This love is strong (Why do I feel weak? Oh, wake me)

[MERCEDES (with KURT, RACHEL, & SANTANA), {SANTANA}, (with SANTANA), (KURT, RACHEL, & SANTANA)]
I'm shaking {Ooh-ooh}
I wish I had you (Near me now, uh huh)
(Said there's no) mistaking (Ooh-ooh)
What I feel is (Really love) (Aha)
Oh, tell me

[KURT & RACHEL, (MERCEDES & SANTANA)]
If he loves me (If he loves me)
If he loves me

[KURT, MERCEDES, RACHEL, & SANTANA, (MERCEDES)]
If he loves me not (Oh-oh, yeah)

[KURT & RACHEL, (MERCEDES & SANTANA)]
If he loves me (If he loves me)
If he loves me

[KURT, MERCEDES, RACHEL, & SANTANA]
If he loves me not

[RACHEL]
Oh! How will I know?

[KURT, MERCEDES & SANTANA]
How will I know?

[MERCEDES & SANTANA]
If he's thinking of me

[KURT, MERCEDES, RACHEL, & SANTANA, (MERCEDES & SANTANA), {KURT & RACHEL}]
I try to phone (But I'm too shy) {Can't speak}
Falling in love (Is all bitter sweet)
This love is strong (Why do I feel weak?)

[MERCEDES]
How will I know?

[KURT, RACHEL, & SANTANA (MERCEDES)]
How will I know if he really loves me? (How will I know? Hey, how will I know?)
I say a prayer with every heart beat (How will I know? Ooh, how will I know?)
I fall in love whenever we meet (How will I know? Yeah, how will I know?)
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things (How will I know? Yeah)

[KURT, MERCEDES, RACHEL, & SANTANA]
How will I know?
