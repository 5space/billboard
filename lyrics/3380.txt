[Verse 1: Harry & Zayn]
Who's that shadow holding me hostage? I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to being held by you

[Chorus: All]
Baby, look what you've done to me (Oh)
Baby, look what you've done now (Oh)
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Ooh ooh)
Baby, look what you've done to me (Oh)
Baby, you got me tied down (Oh)
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Ooh ooh)

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Who's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes? (Ooh ooh)
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind (Ooh ooh)
I know they'll be coming to find me soon (Ooh ooh)
But my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you

[Chorus: All]
Baby, look what you've done to me (Oh)
Baby, look what you've done now (Oh)
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Ooh ooh)
Baby, look what you've done to me (Oh)
Baby, you got me tied down (Oh)
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Ooh ooh)

[Bridge: Liam & Harry]
All my life I've been on my own (Ooh ooh)
I used the light to guide me home (Ooh ooh)
But now together we're alone (Ooh ooh)
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go
(Look what you've done to me)
Baby, look what you've done

[Chorus: All]
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done now
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Ooh ooh)
Baby, look what you've done to me (Look what you've done to me, baby)
Baby, you got me tied down (Look what you've done to me, baby)
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Ooh ooh)

[Outro: All]
(Look what you've done to me, baby
Look what you've done to me, baby)
Baby, look what you've done
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done to me
