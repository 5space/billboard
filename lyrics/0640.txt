[Verse 1]
Boy, so what's been on your mind?
For me, it's just you all the time
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I, we'll be alright
'Cause here, we get to take our time
You, you're finer than some wine
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I, we'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So when you're ready, baby

[Chorus]
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, your love"
My, my, my, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, yeah yeah"
'Cause you're what I adore, babe

[Verse 2]
After that
When you catch your breath
You look at me and say
"Love, are you real?"
Just don't pretend you're just a friend, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So when you're ready, baby

[Chorus]
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, your love"
My, my, my, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, yeah, yeah"
'Cause you're what I adore, babe

[Bridge]
Just don't pretend you're just a friend
Don't pretend you're just a friend
Don't pretend (Don't pretend) you're just a friend
Don't pretend you're just a friend, boy

[Chorus]
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, your love"
My, my, my, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, yeah, yeah"
'Cause you're what I adore, babe
