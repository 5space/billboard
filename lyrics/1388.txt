[Intro: Camila]
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

[Verse 1: Camila]
I don't admit it, I play it cool
But every minute that I'm with you
I feel the fever and I won't lie, I break a sweat
My body's telling all the secrets I ain't told you yet

[Pre-Chorus: Ally]
Oh oh, I struggle to contain
Woah oh, the love that's in my veins
Oh oh, and how it circulates
Oh oh

[Chorus: Camila]
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
You're taken over the beat of my body, you just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body but you lift me up, lift me up
If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer

[Verse 2: Lauren]
So close together, so far apart
You're turning me on and my fire's waiting for your spark

[Pre-Chorus: Ally]
Oh oh, I struggle to contain
Woah oh, the love that's in my veins
Oh oh, and how it circulates
Oh oh

[Chorus: Camila]
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
You're taken over the beat of my body, you just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body but you lift me up, lift me up
If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer

[Bridge: Normani & Ally & Camila]
The truth is out, no stopping now, I'm getting closer
I've had enough, undress my love, I'm coming over
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer, oh
And if you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer, hammer, oh
If you take my pulse

[Chorus: Camila + Ally]
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer (Oh!)
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
You're taken over the beat of my body, you just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body but you lift me up, lift me up
If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
