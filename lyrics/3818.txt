[Intro]
(You got what it takes you can win)

[Verse 1]
You got what it takes, you can win
Today is your day to begin
Don't give up here, don't you quit
The moment is now, this is it
I know that you can, then you will
Get to the top of the hill
Part of the fun is the climb
You just gotta make up your mind

[Chorus]
That today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, today, today, today

[Verse 2]
When somebody throws sticks and stones
All they can break are your bones
And life's gonna kick you around
Then kick you again when you're down

[Chorus]
But today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, today, today, today

[Bridge]
Life's gonna kick you
It's gonna kick you around
It's gonna kick you down

[Verse 3]
Brush yourself up, no regrets
This is as good as it gets
Don't expect more or less
Just go out and give it your best (Give it your best)

[Chorus]
Today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, yeah
Today, said today is your day

[Outro]
Today, today, yeah
I said today, yeah
Today
Today is your day, hey, mmm
