[Verse 1: Sia]
I was bound, was tired
Hadn't seen a light so long
Thought I lost my fight
Couldn't find my way back home
And I found the light stepping out of me
I was bound, and tired
Waiting for daylight

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed
I should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all

[Chorus: Sia]
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Instead I rose above it all
Bang my head against the wall

[Verse 2: Sia]
When you think of giving up
Just know, you might think you're dying but you won't
And you feel the love stepping out of you
But when you think of giving up, don't

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Bang your head against the wall
Though you feel light headed, now you know you will not fall
You will rise above it all
Found what you was searching for
Though you feel light headed
You should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead you rose above it all

[Chorus: Sia]
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Instead I rose above it all
Bang my head against the wall

[Bridge: Sia]
I have broken wings
I keep trying, keep trying
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flying, oh I'm flying

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed
I should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all

[Chorus: Sia]
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Instead I rose above it all
