[Intro]
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah girl, been diggin' on you
Sippin' on drink number two
Tryin' to come up with somethin' smooth
And waitin' on the right time to make my move
But I just can't wait no more
Can't let you slip out that door
Prettiest thing I ever seen before
Got me spinnin' around, I ain't even on the dance floor

[Chorus]
You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Yeah, gotta get me some of that

[Verse 2]
Little more, what you doin' right there?
Swingin' your hips and slingin' your hair
Side to side with your drink in the air
Lord have mercy, now girl, I swear (I swear)
Gotta get your number in my phone
Gotta get me some of you alone (All alone)
We can worry 'bout it later on
Right now keep makin' this my favorite song

[Chorus]
You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Some of that
Yeah, I gotta get me some of that

[Bridge]
In my ride, by my side, down the highway
In the dark, in my arms, in your driveway
All because of that smile you threw my way
Yeah, girl, you got a way of

[Chorus]
You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
I gotta get me some of that

[Outro]
Yeah, I gotta get me some of that
Oh girl, I gotta get me some of that
Oh yeah
Mmm, mmm
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor
I want it now and later
