Summer lovin' had me a blast

[MERCEDES]
Summer lovin' happened so fast

[SAM]
I met a girl crazy for me

[MERCEDES]
Met a boy cute as can be

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Summer days driftin' away
To uh-oh those summer nights

[SAM with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
She swam by me, she got a cramp

[MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
He ran by me, got my suit damp

[SAM with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
I saved her life, she nearly drowned

[MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
He showed off, splashing around

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Summer sun, something's begun
But uh-oh those summer nights

[SAM with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
Took her bowling in the arcade

[MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
We went strolling, drank lemonade

[SAM with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
We made out under the dock

[MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
We stayed out 'till ten o'clock

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Summer fling, don't mean a thing
But uh-oh those summer nights

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Uh well-a well-a well-a huh

[NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS]

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop,shoo-bop bop
Shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, YEAH!

[MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
He got friendly, holding my hand

[SAM with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
While she got friendly down in the sand

[MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
He was sweet, just turned eighteen

[SAM with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
Well, she was good, you know what I mean

[NEW DIRECTIONS]

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Summer heat, boy and girl meet
But uh-oh those summer nights

[SANTANA]
How much dough did he spend?

[NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS]
Tell me more, tell me more

[RORY]
Could she get me a friend?

[SAM]
It turned colder - that's where it ends

[MERCEDES]
So I told him we'd still be friends

[SAM]
Then we made our true love vow

[MERCEDES]
Wonder what he's doing now

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Summer dreams ripped at the seams
Bu-ut oh those summer nights...!

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Tell me more, tell me more!
