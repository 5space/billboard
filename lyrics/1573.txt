[APRIL]
One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy, but all I do is cry

[WILL]
Cry, cry no more laughter

[APRIL]
Oh, I should be happy

[WILL]
Oh, why did she go?

[APRIL]
I only know that since he left, my life's so empty
Though I try to forget, it just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings, I still run

[APRIL]
I don't know how in the world to stop thinking of him

[WILL]
I should be happy

[APRIL]
'Cause I still love him so
I end each day the way I start out, crying my heart out

[WILL]
I start and end each day crying

[APRIL]
One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man

[WILL]
One less man

[APRIL]
To pick up after
No more laughter, no more love
Since he went awaY

[WILL]
Since she went away

[APRIL]
Since he went away

Oooh, a chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
Well, I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair and turn the key
Oh please, be there, still in love with me

[WILL]
One less bell to answer

[APRIL]
Each time the doorbell rings I still run

[WILL]
Will: One less egg to fry

[APRIL]
I got one less man

[WILL]
One less man

[APRIL]
To pick up after

[WILL]
No more

[APRIL]
No more laughter, no more love
Since he went away

[WILL]
Since she went away

[APRIL]
Since he went away
All I do is cry
