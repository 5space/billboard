[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Rozay a born stunner, I could blow money (Ugh!)
Fifty when I'm shoppin', that ain't no money (Ugh!)

I got forty whips (Forty whips), way too much in 'em (Much in 'em)
I need me a queen (Queen), I need me a dime (Dime)
Livin' this fast life, just show me a sign (Sign)
I'm a G (I'm a G), I'm-I'm-I'm a G
Took her from the lame, put her on that condo on the beach (On the beach)
All she needs, all-all-all-all she needs
Is a boss on my level who provides her every need (Every need)
All I fiend is a queen in my presence, I can hold her til' I die
Couple G's in my bezel, I'm a boss

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Still runnin' the streets 'cause every day I'm hustlin' (Every day I'm hustlin')
Double MG winnin' and the streets is lovin' it (Mayback Music)
All this paper comin' and my baby touchin' it (Touchin' it)
I pin her to the wall, you know this boy be bustin' it (Bustin' it)
Fur coats in the winter, look like a polar bear (Polar bear)
Stunting in the snow, these haters they can go somewhere, yeah
Indoor pool (Indoor pool), outdoor pool (Outdoor pool), indoor court
Talkin' Ray J moves (Ray J moves)
Seven Rolls Royces, pink slips like a boss (Boss)
Champagne on her body, time to lick it off (Lick it off)
Me and baby girl a winnin' combination  (Combination)
Ownership is my conversation, I'm a boss

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Rick Ross]
I'll do anything that you say
Anything 'cause you the boss
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, ayy
You the boss (Boss)
You, you, you the boss, ayy (Boss)

You, you, you the boss, ayy

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj & Rick Ross]
Talk to me
I watch, you play (What you sayin' baby?)
And I'll do whatever you say (Boss)
Oh, I watch, you play
And I'll do whatever you say

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Rick Ross]

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Rick Ross]
You could take it any way you want to
Daddy, I promise that I'll never disappoint you
Just make sure I make it my motherfuckin' point to
Get a raise (Ugh!)
Get a raise (Ugh!)
Aaah

You the bo-o-o-o-oss, boss
The bo-o-o-o-oss, boss
You the bo-o-o-o-oss, ugh!
The bo-o-o-o-oss man, ugh!
You the bo-o-o-o-oss

Hey daddy, won’t you come and be my boss? (Be my boss?)
Let me work it for you with no days off (Days off)
Hey daddy, won’t you come and be my boss? (Be my boss?)
With no days off (Ugh!)
