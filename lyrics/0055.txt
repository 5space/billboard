[Intro: Michael & Luke]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh
Here’s to teenage memories
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh
Here’s to teenage ---

[Verse 1: Luke]
Can I call, wake you up on a Sunday?
Late night, I think we need to get away
Headlights, hold tight, turn the radio loud
Let me know where to go and I’ll get you there
Tell the truth and I’ll show you how to dare
Flash lights held tight, we can own this town

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Never say goodbye

[Chorus: Luke & Michael]
And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
And tell me that I’ll see you again
'Cause I don’t know if I can let you go
And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
I’m dying just to see you again
Let’s make tonight the best of our lives, yeah
Here’s to teenage memories
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh
Here’s to teenage memories

[Verse 2: Calum]
Close your eyes, you’ll be mine and it’s alright
Take a breath, no rest ‘til the sunrise
Heartbeat, so sweet when your lips touch mine
We don’t have to go home right now
We’re never gonna stop 'cause we’re dreaming out loud
We know what we want, we know we’re gonna get it somehow

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Never say goodbye

[Chorus: Luke & Calum]
And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
And tell me that I’ll see you again
'Cause I don’t know if I can let you go
And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
I’m dying just to see you again
Let’s make tonight the best of our lives, yeah
Here’s to teenage memories, oh, oh
Here’s to teenage memories, oh, oh

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus: Luke & Michael]
And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
And tell me that I’ll see you again
'Cause I don’t know if I can let you go
And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
I’m dying just to see you again
Let’s make tonight the best of our lives, yeah
Here’s to teenage memories
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh
Here’s to teenage memories
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh
Here’s to teenage memories
