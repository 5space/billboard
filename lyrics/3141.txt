[Intro: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I hear you knock, knock, knock, baby, come on up
I hope you got, got, got something in yo' cup
'Cause I'm three shots deep and I ain't tryna sleep
Get your Redbull on 'cause I'm ready

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been playin' hard-to-get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you wan' do
Tell me what you gon' do
Whatchu gon' do?

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
Whatchu gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave, but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down-down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like

[Post-Chorus]
I'ma make it sound like

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Are you tryna make me wait, wait, wait 'til the second day?
But I can't, can't, can't even contemplate
Waiting one more minute, lemme jump in it
I brought you flowers and a teddy

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been playin' hard-to-get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you wan' do
Tell me what you gon' do
Whatchu gon' do?

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
Whatchu gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave, but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down-down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I can make it sound like

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Now, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive, girl, you know you like that
Say, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive, girl, you know you like that

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
Whatchu gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave, but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down-down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I'ma, yeah, I'ma make it

[Outro]
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl...
