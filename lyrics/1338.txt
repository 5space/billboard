[Verse 1]
Beer don't keep
Loveâ€™s not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink
Daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well
Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Verse 2]
Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's got a past
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Bridge]
When you can take it slow
'Cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her 'til your glass runs out of sand

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it
Some of it
