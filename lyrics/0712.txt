[Intro]
Ow!
Ho!
Ow!

[Verse 1]
Baby, does he do it for you?
When he's finished, does he step back and adore you?
I just gotta know, 'cause your time is money
And I won't let him waste it, oh no-n (Ow!)
Baby, just go with it
'Cause when you're with me, I can't explain it, it's just different
We can take it slow or act like you're my girl, let's skip the basics
Whoa-whoa, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so replaceable
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, uh, da-da-da)
You're worth the chase you're putting on
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da)

[Chorus]
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable, a collectible
Just like fine china

[Verse 2]
Favorite, you're my favorite
It's like all the girls around me don't have faces
And the saying goes
Life is just a game but I'm not playing
Whoa-whoa, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so replaceable (Woo-hoo)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, uh, da-da-da)
You're worth the chase you're putting on
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da)

[Chorus]
It's alright (Yeah), I'm not dangerous
When you're mine (Woo), I'll be generous
(You are) You're irreplaceable, a collectible (Just like)
Just like fine china
It's alright (Girl), I'm not dangerous (I'm not dangerous)
When you're mine (Girl), I'll be generous
(You are) You're irreplaceable, (You are) A collectible (Hey!)
(You are) just like fine china

[Bridge]
Took me a while (Yeah) to find your love (Hey!)
Ain't no amount of time in this world (Ho!)
Save me a lot of time and just love me (Hey!)
Feel it, baby, feel it in your soul
Are you ready? (oh)
I know your heart been telling you, you belong to me (Haha)
A-na-na, no-whoa

[Chorus]
It's alright (Yeah, whoa!), I'm not dangerous (I'm not dangerous, hey!)
When you're mine (Whoa, I'll get you girl), I'll be generous (I, I, no)
You're irreplaceable, a collectible
Just like fine china

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh
Yeah
Uh
Oh, oh no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
