[Verse 1]
It's two tickets to a concert
It's a Daytona airbrush T-shirt
Wondering who's gonna kiss you first
You know what I'm talking about

[Verse 2]
Hey baby, whatcha doing tonight?
It's butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes
Of a beach towel in a Spring Break town

[Pre-Chorus]
It's playing in the night air
Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just living
That American country love song

[Chorus]
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on and on and on

[Verse 3]
It's Chris loves Jenny on a license plate
It's daddy getting mad cause you came home late
It's one last kiss in the driveway
Hey, radio DJ can you play that song that she loves
So I can turn it up and maybe turn her on
An American country love song

[Chorus]
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on, and on, and on, and on

[Bridge]
So let's raise a glass, cheerleaders and quarterbacks
Cowboys and country girls, all around this small town world
To the same old pick up lines, we've tried a million times
All the bad and good as it gets
To the ones that you ain't met yet

[Chorus]
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on, and on, and on
