[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I eat up the seconds, times and reasons for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up in you, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this lovin' like we never done it
Baby, I'm in love
Go 'head, show me love like we never done it
Ooh, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Show me love, love
Show me love, love

[Verse: Alicia Keys, Miguel, Alicia Keys & Miguel]
Show me love like you see red lights
And you crashed in it like a deer inside of headlights
Yeah, I show you love like it was passionate
I just wanna bask in it, winnin' it like a championship
You gon' show me love like, like you tried it (Yeah) and denied it (Yeah)
But you still let me apply it (Yeah) like I made you put your ties in
Show me lo-o-ove, even when you don't got time to
I'll be there to find ya, I'll remind ya

[Chorus: Alicia Keys, Miguel, Alicia Keys & Miguel]
Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I eat up the seconds, times and reasons for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up in you, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this lovin' like we never done it
Baby, I'm in love
Go 'head, show me love like we never done it
Ooh, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Show me love, love, love, love, love
Show me love, love, love, love, love

[Bridge: Miguel & Alicia Keys, Miguel]
Baby, you know what it is, yeah
You know what it is, yeah
Baby, you know what it is, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
You know what it is, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
You gon' show me what it means to love (Yeah)

You gon' show me what it means to love (Yeah)
What it is

[Chorus: Alicia Keys, Miguel, Alicia Keys & Miguel]
Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I eat up the seconds, times and minutes for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up, baby, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this lovin' (We gon' get it, get it)
Like we never done it (We never did it)
Baby, I'm in love
Go 'head, show me love like we never done it
Yeah, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
