[Verse 1]
Do what you, what you want
If you have a dream for better
Do what you, what you want
'Til you don’t want it anymore (Remember who you really are)

[Verse 2]
Do what you, what you want
Your world’s closing in on you now (It isn’t over)
Stand and face the unknown (Got to remember who you really are)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every heart in my hands
Like a pale reflection

[Chorus 1]
Hello, hello, remember me?
I’m everything you can’t control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
We can break through

[Verse 3]
Do what you, what you want
You don’t have to lay your life down (It isn’t over)
Do what you, what you want
‘Til you find what you’re looking for (Got to remember who you really are)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But every hour slipping by
Screams that I have failed you

[Chorus 2]
Hello, hello, remember me?
I’m everything you can’t control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe

[Chorus 2]
Hello, hello, remember me?
I’m everything you can’t control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe

[Bridge]
There’s still time
Close your eyes
Only love will guide you home
Tear down the walls and free your soul
'Til we crash
We’re forever spiraling
Down, down, down, down

[Chorus 3]
Hello, hello
It’s only me infecting everything you love
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe

[Chorus 4]
Hello, hello, remember me?
I’m everything you can’t control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to learn forgiveness

[Chorus 1]
Hello, hello, remember me?
I’m everything you can’t control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
We can break through

[Outro]
Remember who you really are
Do what you, what you want
