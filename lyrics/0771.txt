[Intro]
Ah-ah
Ah-ah

[Verse 1]
I came here tonight to get sh- out of my mind
I'm gonna take what I find, uh-oh, yeah
So open the box, don't need no key, I'm unlocked
And I won't tell you to stop, uh-oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey boy! I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in, no need for talkin'
Hey boy! So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin'

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
It's true what you heard, I am a freak, I'm disturbed
So come on and give me your worst, uh-oh, yeah, haha
We're moving faster than slow, if you don't know where to go
I'll finish off on my own, oh-oh, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey boy! I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in, no need for talkin'
Hey boy! So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin', say, say, hey!

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Your body, yeah, woo!)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah-eah, hey yeah)

[Bridge]
I think you already know my name
I think you already know my name!
Hey, hey, yeah! Ha, alright, say!
I think you already know my name

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is love your body (Ah-ah-ah yeah!)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Hey, hey, say!)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Woo, ooh!)
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Say, say, hey, yeah)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
