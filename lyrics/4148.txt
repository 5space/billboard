[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Into the night, desperate and broken
The sound of a fight, father has spoken

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell, heaven and hell

[Verse 2]
Into your eyes, hopeless and taken
We stole our new lives through blood and name
In defense of our dreams
In defense of our dreams

[Chorus]
We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell, heaven and hell

[Bridge]
The age of man is over
A darkness comes at dawn
These lessons that we've learned here
Have only just begun

[Chorus]
We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell

[Outro]
We are the kings
We are the queens
We are the kings
We are the queens
