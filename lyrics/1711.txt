[RACHEL]
The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes

[TINA]
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave

[TINA with MERCEDES, RACHEL, and SANTANA]
To the dark, (To the dark) and the end of the skies

[MERCEDES, RACHEL, and SANTANA]
My love

[MERCEDES]
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird

[TINA with MERCEDES, RACHEL, and SANTANA]
That was there (that was there) at my command
My love

[SANTANA]
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine

[MERCEDES]
And I knew our joy would fill the earth

[MERCEDES with RACHEL, SANTANA, and TINA]
And last (And last) 'til the end of time
My love

[RACHEL]
And the first time ever I saw

[TINA with MERCEDES, RACHEL, and SANTANA]
Your face

[MERCEDES with RACHEL, SANTANA, and TINA]
Your face

[SANTANA with MERCEDES, RACHEL, and TINA]
Your face

[RACHEL with MERCEDES, SANTANA, and TINA]
Your face
