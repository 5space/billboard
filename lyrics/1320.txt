[Verse 1]
Loving you was easy
Thought you'd never leave me
Yeah, yeah
Wrapped around my finger
See you when I see ya
Yeah, yeah
Now I'm hearing around
That you've been running around
I didn't think I'd miss you
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
It hit me like a heart attack
When you finally left me girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world with without you
I don't wanna live in a world with without you
I don't wanna live in a world with without you

[Verse 2]
Never really noticed
All the little things you did, you did
Never bought you roses
Always was around my friends, my friends
And now I'm hearing around
That you've been running around
I didn't think I'd miss you
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
It hit me like a heart attack
When you finally left me girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world with without you
I don't wanna live in a world with without you
I don't wanna live in a world with without you

[Bridge]
Never should've let you slip away
Living in a world that's turned to gray
Little did I know it'd hurt so bad (So bad), ohh

[Chorus]
'Cause it hit me like a heart attack
When you finally left me girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world with without you
I don't wanna live in a world with without you
I don't wanna live in a world with without you

[Post-Chorus]
You (You, ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, oh
You (You, ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, oh
I don't wanna live in a world with without you

[Outro]
Now I'm hearing around
That you've been running around
I didn't think I'd miss you
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Ooh-ooh
