[Verse 1]
In the crowd, alone
And every second passing
Reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds
Are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

[Pre-Chorus]
All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

[Chorus]
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

[Verse 2]
Like a rock, I float
Sweat and conversations
Seep into my bone
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the
Unknown, unknown

[Pre-Chorus]
All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

[Chorus]
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
Glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

[Chorus]
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin
