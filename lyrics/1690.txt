[SANTANA]
Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play

[TINA]
Every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[MERCEDES]
And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way

[MERCEDES & TINA]
I'm always dragging that horse around
Our love is pastured, such a mournful sound

[MERCEDES]
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground

[SANTANA]
So I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

[MERCEDES & TINA]
Shake it out, shake it out

[MERCEDES with SANTANA & TINA]
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

[TINA with MERCEDES]
And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart

[SANTANA with MERCEDES, (MERCEDES), {SANTANA}]
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest (Before the dawn) {Before the dawn}

[MERCEDES with TINA]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa

[MERCEDES with SANTANA & TINA]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

[SANTANA]
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

[MERCEDES]
And given half the chance, would I take any of it back?

[TINA]
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone

[MERCEDES, SANTANA & TINA]
It's always darkest before the dawn
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[SANTANA (& TINA)]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
(So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope)

[SANTANA (& MERCEDES)]
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
(It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat, 'cause)

[MERCEDES]
Looking for heaven

[MERCEDES with SANTANA]
Found the devil in me
Looking for heaven

[MERCEDES]
Found the devil in me
But what the hell

[MERCEDES with SANTANA & TINA]
I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah

[SANTANA & TINA (MERCEDES), {with MERCEDES}]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa (Oah, oh)
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah (Shake it out)

And it's hard to dance (When it's hard to dance)
With a devil on your back
{So shake him off} oh whoa
(Ouh, shake it off)

Shake it out, shake it out (Yeah)
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah (Shake it out)
Shake it out, shake it out (Shake it out)
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa (Eeey)

And it's {Mercedes: hard to dance} with a devil on your back
{So shake him off} oh woah

(Oh-oh, ooh-whoa, oh-oh)

Shake it out, shake it out (Shake it out)
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah (Shake it out)
Shake it out, shake it out (Ey, yeah)
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah (Ey-eh-eh-ey)

[SANTANA with MERCEDES & TINA]
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off

[SANTANA & TINA (MERCEDES)]
Oh whoa (Oh, ooh, ooh, woah)
