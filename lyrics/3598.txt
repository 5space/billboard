[Verse 1: Rascal Flatts]
We broke up, yeah, it's tough
Most guys would've been crushed
Wasting their time, wondering where they went wrong
No way, not me
Hey, I'm doing just fine
I'm not afraid of moving on

[Chorus: Rascal Flatts]
It's easy going out on a Friday night
Easy every time I see her out
I can smile, live it up
The way a single guy does
But what she, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy

[Verse 2: Natasha Bedingfield]
The truth is I miss lying in those arms of his
But I don't ever let it show
I laugh and I act like I'm having the time of my life
As far as he knows

[Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield]
It's easy going out on a Friday night
Easy, every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up
The way a single girl does
But, what he, what he don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy
Oh, it's easy

[Chorus: Rascal Flatts & Natasha Bedingfield]
Oh, it's easy going out on a Friday night
Oh, it's easy, every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up
Forget about the way, oh
But, what she, oh what he don't know, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy

[Outro: Rascal Flatts & Natasha Bedingfield]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, it looks so easy
So easy, yeah-ooh
