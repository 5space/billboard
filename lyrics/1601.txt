[FINN]
It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

[MERCEDES]
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

[RACHEL]
But say a prayer
Pray for the other one
Oh, at Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun

[BLAINE & KURT, (BLAINE)]
(There's a) world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

[ARTIE & BRITTANY]
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears

[PUCK & TINA]
And the Christmas bells that ring
Are the clanging chimes of doom

[MERCEDES (with RACHEL)]
Well tonight thank God it's them (Instead of you)

[ARTIE & TINA with NEW DIRECTIONS, (SANTANA), {with SANTANA}]
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time (This Christmas time, no)
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (Is life)
Where nothing ever grows (Nothing ever grows)
No rain or rivers flow (Oh, rivers flow, no)
Do they know it's {Christmas time at all?}

Here's to you (Raise a glass for everyone)
Here's to them (Underneath that burning sun)
Do they know it's Christmas time at all? (Do they know it's Christmas time at all, yeah)

[TINA with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Da-da-da-da-da
Da, da-daah
Da-da-da-da-da

[BRAINE & BRITTANY (with RACHEL) & NEW DIRECTIONS]
Feed (the world)

[ARTIE & TINA with NEW DIRECTIONS, (with RACHEL)]
Let them know it's (Christmas time) again

[BLAINE & BRITTANY (with RACHEL) & NEW DIRECTIONS]

[ARTIE & TINA with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Let them know it's Christmas time again

[BLAINE & BRITTANY (with RACHEL) & NEW DIRECTIONS]

Let them know it's (Christmas time) again

Let them know it's Christmas time (Again)
