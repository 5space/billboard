[RACHEL]
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling
I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

[RACHEL & SANTANA]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[SANTANA]
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

[RACHEL & (NEW DIRECTIONS)]
It's the way I'm feeling
I just can't deny (I just can't deny)

[RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS]
But I've gotta let it go
Oh, woah, woah

[RACHEL & SANTANA with NEW DIRECTIONS]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[RACHEL (& SANTANA), {SANTANA}]
Yellow diamonds in the light {In the light}
Now we're standing side by side {Oh-oh, oh-oh}
As your shadow (Crosses mine)

[SANTANA]
We found love

[RACHEL (& SANTANA) with NEW DIRECTIONS, {SANTANA}]
We found love in a hopeless place {Ooh-ooh}
