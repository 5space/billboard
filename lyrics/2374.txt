[Verse 1: Miranda Lambert]
Rear-view crosses
Railroad ties
Oh Hail Marys
Friday nights
Heartbeat baby
Low-beam lights
God I miss when, you were mine

[Chorus: Miranda Lambert & Keith Urban]
Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin' bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin' that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

[Verse 2: Keith Urban]
Shotgun sunset
A cool mint kiss
Backseat promise
Breaking it
Floorboard feeling
County lines
God, I miss when you were mine

[Chorus: Miranda Lambert & Keith Urban]
Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin' bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin' that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

[Verse 3: Keith Urban & Miranda Lambert]
In a sleepy town, just jumping in
Far too young to know that summers end
We were us, we can't go back
It's what it is, but God I miss

[Chorus: Miranda Lambert & Keith Urban]
Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin' bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin' that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

[Verse 4: Miranda Lambert & Keith Urban]
Every beat, every line, every word, every single time
I just close my eyes and you're ridin' shotgun
You and me, baby, on the run
I miss you baby
I miss you baby
