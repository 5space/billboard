[Verse 1]
I've been working as a temp
At the local factory
I hope they hire me on full time
I've got shoes to buy
And a mouth to feed

I drive a buy here, pay here truck
It ain't new, but it is for me
It ain't much but it fires right up
And get me from A to B

[Pre - Chorus]
What puts the dirt underneath my nails
What keeps the calluses on my hands
Family man

[Chorus]
They're a world my world revolves around
My sacred piece of solid ground
The flesh and bone that gives me strength to stand
They are a fire in my drivin on
The drive behind my comin home
The livin, breathin, reason that I am
A family man

[Verse 2]
There's dirty shirts to wash
Dishes in the sink to do
And there's how many times
Does 17 go into 52

There's bedtime prayers to pray
Sleep tights and I love you's
And then there's a pair of eyes
I get to lose myself into

[Pre- Chorus]
What keeps me keepin the faith
What makes me believe I can
Family man

[Chorus]
They're a world my world revolves around
My sacred piece of solid ground
The flesh and bone that gives me strength to stand
They are a fire in my drivin on
The drive behind my comin home
The livin, breathin, reason that I am
A family man

[Outro]
There's a fire in my drivin on
The drive behind my comin home
The livin, breathin, reason that I am
A family man

A family man
