[Verse 1]
I heard from a friend of a friend of a friend that
You finally got rid of that girlfriend
You finally came out of that love coma, boy

I heard Mary Jane at the Powder Puff Beauty Shop
Sayin' that blonde in her tube top
She left our Jimmy for a boy in Illinois

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone give me an amen
Someone give me an amen

[Chorus]
Can I get a thank God, hallelujah?
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it, she was right
Glad to see you saw the lie

Whole town, yeah, we whooped and hollered
She drove away, nobody stopped her
Na-na, na-na-na, I'll say it again
Someone give me an amen

[Verse 2]
Yeah, right, like I really could've said something
You wouldn't have heard it if a train was coming
You had your head so high in the clouds

Oh, I, I had a really good reason
For hiding my feelings
But now I can finally spit it out

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone give me an amen
Someone give me an amen

[Chorus]
Can I get a thank God, hallelujah?
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it, she was right
Glad to see you saw the lie

Whole town, yeah, we whooped and hollered
She drove away, nobody stopped her
Na-na, na-na-na, I'll say it again
Someone give me an Amen

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm standing right here in front of you
I think I love you too

[Chorus]
Can I get a thank God, hallelujah?
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it, she was right
Glad to see you saw the lie

Whole town, yeah, we whooped and hollered
The preacher's son and the farmer's daughter
Na-na, na-na-na, I'll say it again
Someone give me an amen
Someone give me an amen
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
