[Intro: Zayn]
Diana

[Verse 1: Liam & Harry]
The front pages are your pictures, they make you look so small
How could someone not miss you at all?
I never would mistreat you, oh I'm not a criminal
I speak a different language, but I still hear your call

[Chorus: Zayn]
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Diana

[Verse 2: Niall & Louis]
It's only been four months, but you've fallen down so far
How could someone mislead you at all?
I wanna reach out for ya, I wanna break these walls
I speak a different language, but I still hear you call

[Chorus: Zayn]
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine

[Bridge: Harry]
We all need something
This can't be over now
If I could hold ya
I swear I'd never put you down

[Chorus: Zayn & Harry]
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Diana, Diana
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Diana, Diana
Baby, you'd be saving mine
