[VOCAL ADRENALINE & (JESSE)]
Bum, bum, bum
Ba da ba, ba da bum
Bum, bum, bum
Ba da ba ba da bum
Bum, bum, bum (Ooohh - Let's go!)
Ba da ba ba da bum

[JESSE & (VOCAL ADRENALINE BOYS)]
Steve walks wearily down the street
With his brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready (Hey!)
Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

[JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS]
Yeah!

[VOCAL ADRENALINE BOYS, (JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS)]
Bum, bum, bum (Another one bites the dust)
Bum, bum, bum (Another one bites the dust; And another one gone)
And another one gone (Another one bites the dust, yeah)
Hey, I'm gonna get you to

[JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE, (VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS), {VOCAL ADRENALINE BOYS}]
Another one bites the dust (Oooh, ohh!) {Yeeaah!}

[JESSE (with VOCAL ADRENALINE)]
How do you think I'm gonna get along (Without you when you're gone?)
You took me for everything that I had and (Kicked me out on my own)

[JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS]
Are you happy? Are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

[JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Look Out!

[VOCAL ADRENALINE BOYS, (JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS)]
Bum, bum, bum (Another one bites the dust)
Bum, bum, bum (Another one bites the dust; And another one gone)
And another one gone (Another one bites the dust, yeah)
Hey, I'm gonna get you to, another one bites the dust (Oooh, ohh!)

[JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE, (JESSE), {VOCAL ADRENALINE BOYS}, (/VOCAL ADRENALINE\)]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust (Jesse: Oooh!)
Another one bites the dust {Hey, hey!}
Another one bites the dust (/Heeeeeeeey\)

[JESSE]
Ooh shoot out

[JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE, (JESSE)]
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah!
But I'm ready, I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat (Oh, Yeah)

[VOCAL ADRENALINE BOYS, (JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS), {JESSE}]
Bum, bum, bum (Another one bites the dust)
Bum, bum, bum (Another one bites the dust; And another one gone)
And another one gone (Another one bites the dust, yeah)
Hey, I'm gonna get you to, another one bites the dust {Shoot out!}
Another one bites the dust {Yeah}
Another one bites the dust {Alright}
