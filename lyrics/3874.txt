[Intro]
It's my number one girl
It's my number one girl

[Verse 1]
Where she go?
Where she at?
That's my girl, got my back
When I need her, always there
Hold me down, like no one else
When stupid boys come around
Me and my girls shut 'em down
Nobody can stop us now
Gonna take over, we run this town
All night long

[Pre-Chorus]
If you got a friend like that, like that, like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that, like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that, like that, like that, like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that, (then send them in) like that, like that, like that, like that

[Chorus]
You're my best friend forever
Cross my heart and hope to die
You ain't gotta worry never
You're my best friend for life

[Verse 2]
I'm your number one girl, I'm your best friend
And I'll always be there, right 'till the end
Sophia Grace got your back, just know that
And that's the reason why I'm rappin' on this hot track
I'll take it to the top, I'm never gonna stop
Eleven years old, that's just how I rock
So if you are my best friend put your hands up, now put your hands up
Woah!

[Pre-Chorus]
If you got a friend like that, like that, like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that, like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that, like that, like that, like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that, (then send them in) like that, like that, like that, like that

[Chorus]
You're my best friend forever
Cross my heart and hope to die
You ain't gotta worry never
You're my best friend for life

[Bridge]
And if the world's against us (If the world's against us)
And if our backs are up against the world together
With no one to defend us (No one to defend us)
We're gon' make it through it, singing like we do

We gon' laugh at them boys when they talk to us
But they can't get in, we get so annoyed
When they don't understand, it means no, no, no
We don't want no boys 'round here (no boys allowed)
No, we don't want no boys 'round here (no boys allowed)
We don't want no boys 'round here (no boys allowed)

[Chorus]
You're my best friend forever (You're my best friend forever)
Cross my heart and hope to die (You can cross my heart and hope to die)
You ain't got to worry never (You ain't got to worry never, oh no)
You're my best friend for life (You're my best friend for life)
You're my best friend forever (You're my best friend)
Cross my heart and hope to die (For live)
You ain't gotta worry never (You ain't gotta worry never)
You're my best friend for life (You're my best friend for life)

[Outro]
It's my number one girl
It's my number one girl
It's my number one girl
It's my number one girl
