[Verse 1]
Electric lights
Blow my mind
I feel alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Verse 2]
You catch my eye
Bitch, you wanna fly?
I'm so alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

[Verse 3]
I'm such a star
Queen Boulevard
Blaze through the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

[Bridge]
Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

[Outro]
