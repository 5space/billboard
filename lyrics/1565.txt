[QUINN]
I'm sitting in a railway station
Got a ticket for my destination
Oh, oh

[PUCK]
On a tour of one-night stands
My suitcase and guitar in hand

[PUCK & QUINN]
And every stop is neatly planned
For a poet and a one-man band

[MIKE & (SANTANA)]
This wave (Wave)
(Is stringing us along) (Along)

[MIKE with QUINN]
Just know you’re not alone

[MIKE]
'Cause I’m gonna make this place your home

[SANTANA]
Everyday's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
Oh, oh

[MERCEDES with SANTANA]
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see
Reminds me that I long to be

[FINN with ALUMNI, (MERCEDES)]
The trouble, it might drag you down (Ooh)

[FINN with SANTANA & ALUMNI]
If you get lost, you can always be found

[FINN & SANTANA, (MERCEDES)]
Just know you’re not alone (Know you're not alone)

[PUCK & QUINN]
'Cause I’m gonna make this place your home

[ALUMNI & (MERCEDES), {SANTANA}]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah {Where my thought's escaping}
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Where my music's playing)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Oh)

[QUINN]
Where my love lies waiting silently for me

[FINN, MERCEDES, & SANTANA with ALUMNI]
Settle down, it'll all be clear
The trouble, it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found

[FINN & SANTANA (MERCEDES)]
Just know you’re not alone (Know you're not alone)

[PUCK & QUINN (with SANTANA & ALUMNI)]
Cause I’m gonna (make this place your home)

[MERCEDES with ALUMNI (SANTANA)]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Where my music's playing)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[MERCEDES (& SANTANA)]
I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make
Make this place your (Home)

[ALUMNI & (MERCEDES), SANTANA]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Know you're not alone) (Where my music's playing)

[MERCEDES with ALUMNI (SANTANA)]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Woah-oh, aah)

[MERCEDES]
I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make
Make this place our home

[ALUMNI (MERCEDES)]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Know you're not alone)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Oh)
