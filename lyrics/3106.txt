[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

[Verse 1]
Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here

[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

[Verse 2]
If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out

[Bridge]
Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around

[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you, it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out
I was so on fire for you, it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out
