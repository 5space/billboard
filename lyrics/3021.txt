[Verse 1]
I've never been one to ask for help
If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself
I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday
Quote you the scripture kind
I'm far from a preacher
But I'm a believer

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Verse 2]
For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
A touch that kills me too
And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Chorus 2]
Every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain
Girl, even today, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
I prayed for you
I prayed for you
