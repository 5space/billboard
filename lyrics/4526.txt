[Intro: Future]
(Wheezy outta here)

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I used to couldn't see this far
Damn, look how them tables turned
Think I walk on water, but I never let no bridges burn
It's different when it's given to you
All the money, I really earned it
And ain't no one's business, why the fuck am I still they concern?
Ain't the one for trippin', I keep pushin', I'm like lesson learned
I ain't missin' my shot in this shit, everyone don't get a turn
I was thinkin' street, I wanted everyone in verts and Rovers
Now I really see and I got everyone convertin' over
Studio, I'm stayin' at the microphone 'til the session over
Niggas know we came with a lot of strong, took our section over
(Took our section over)

[Chorus: YTB Trench]
I know it hurt, but you still told me that you lied
We made it work, but you still found the ways around it
Extended verse, somehow, we still ain't see the high
I paid the fine, and pay that iron between that line, I smoke that fire
I know it hurt, but you still told me that you lied
We made it work, but you still found the ways around it
Extended verse, somehow, we still ain't see the high
I paid the fine, and I'd do it again

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Gunna]
Half a million dollars on me, I feel it in my chromosomes
I don't talk to that bitch, when we meet up, she know I'm only bone
Lifetime, send it, I made millions without a mobile phone
Two hundred thousand stacked up I could bought myself, you need a drone
Tryna put my people on, put my heart in every song
Thugger told me, "That bitch heart ain't right, you need to leave her 'lone"
She a dime, but she ain't got a diamond, that don't make no sense
I don't care, don't waste no time, my next one gon' be heaven-sent
Ran me up some mils, now I'm not comin' off the bench
I been patiently waitin' on my turn, just tell me when is it?
I can spin 'em like Big Worm or Vick, I feed 'em to the pits
Yeah, my whole life has turned, I think I'm gettin' followed by a journalist
I think my life done finally shifted, we on a yacht, look like a ship
I prayed to God to get you hips, and then I got your titties lifted
Never like to fuss and fight, but you throw fists in like they trip
And then seduce me with your lips and I enjoy it

[Chorus: YTB Trench]
I know it hurt, but you still told me that you lied
We made it work, but you still found the ways around it
Extended verse, somehow, we still ain't see the high
I paid the fine, and pay that iron between that line, I smoke that fire
I know it hurt, but you still told me that you lied
We made it work, but you still found the ways around it
Extended verse, somehow, we still ain't see the high
I paid the fine, and I'd do it again

[Verse 3: YTB Trench]
You say that you need a friend
Hold up, lil' bitch, come again
Know you may not know my name
But my net worth a fuckin' M
And that's just what the people know
We move like a pick and roll
Six shots behind screen, wait 'til that three, they comin' at your soul
That lil' bitch a freak (Yeah)
She gon' eat with my Pateky on
I came from the streets, she know I'm G
What she wan' sex me for
Iced out all my P's, down to my C's
Put all my brothers on
I took out my piece, that bitch a freak
She say she love it on
I know she just wanna fuck 'cause I'm rich now
I ran to the top, ain't stunt on shit
Ain't make no pitstops
I ran up the mon' and make it flip
Somethin' like TikTok
Thuggin' in a brick house
Pookie servin' Chris Rock

[Outro: YTB Trench]
If I knew how to spin a bend
Then I'd spin again
We hit a slide every time (Slide out)
And slide out
