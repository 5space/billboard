[ARTIE with THE GROUP]
U can't touch this

[ARTIE & (THE GROUP)]
My-my-my-my (U can't touch this) music hits me so hard
Makes me say, 'oh my lord thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet
It feels good
When you know you're down
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat-uh!
U can't touch

I told you, homeboy

[ARTIE with THE GROUP]
U can't touch this

[ARTIE]

[ARTIE with THE GROUP]
U can't touch this

[ARTIE]
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics

[THE GROUP]
U can't touch this

[ARTIE]
Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that now you know you wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling
Hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that
Like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat
They can't touch

Yo! I told you

[ARTIE with THE GROUP]
U can't touch this

[ARTIE]
Why you standing there, man?

[ARTIE with THE GROUP]
U can't touch this

[ARTIE]
Yo, sound the bells, school is in, sucker

[ARTIE with THE GROUP]
U can't touch this

[ARTIE]
Give me a song or rhythm
Making 'em sweat
That's what I'm giving 'em
Now they know You talk about the Hammer, you're talking about a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What it is going to take in the '90s
To burn the charts
Legit either work hard or you might as well quit

That's the word, because you know

[ARTIE with THE GROUP]
U can't touch this
U can't touch this

[ARTIE]
Break it down

Stop. Hammer time

Go with the flow
It is said
That if you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it for a winter
Dance to this an' you're gonna get thinner
Move slide your rump
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump
Bump bump bump

Yeah

[ARTIE with THE GROUP]
U can't touch this

[ARTIE]

[ARTIE]
Break it down
Stop. Hammer time
Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor
And I'm magic on the mike
Now why would I ever
Stop doing this?
When others making records
That just don't hit
I've toured around the world
From London to the Bay
It's Hammer, go Hammer,M.C.Hammer, Yo Hammer
And the rest can go and play
Can't touch this
