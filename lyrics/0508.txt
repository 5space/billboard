[Intro]
Hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I'm the kind of girl who doesn't say a word
Who sits at the curb and waits for the world
But I'm about to break out, about to break out
I'm like a crook tonight
I caught you staring at me, and I was thinking clearly
And now I'm like a bee and I'm hunting for the honey
And I'm kinda shy, but you're super fly, yeah
I could be your kryptonite, like

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Light my heart up, baby, like a matchstick
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
And hit the gas quick

[Chorus]
Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd, the music's loud
But I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And I'll find you

[Hook]
Ready or not (woah, woah, oh, woah, oh)
Ready or not (woah, woah, oh, woah, oh)

[Verse 2]
Hello, my name is (Bridgit), nice to meet you
I think you're famous, where have I seen you?
You'll be my William, I'll be your Kate
Living like a fairy tale
We could have a palace right next to Oprah
Thirty-seven cars and a yacht down in Boca
Take me away, wherever you say
Yeah, we could be setting sail, like

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Light my heart up, baby, like a matchstick
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
And hit the gas quick

[Chorus]
Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd (oh-oh), the music's loud
But I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song? (yeah)
Just sing it, la-la-la-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
And I'll find you

[Hook]
Ready or not (woah, woah, oh, woah, oh)
Ready or not (woah, woah, oh, woah, oh)
Not, no, woah, oh, woah, oh!

[Bridge]
Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You made me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come boy, it's on
Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You made me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come boy, it's on

[Chorus]
Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young (yeah)
In the crowd, the music's loud
But I will find you (I'll find you)
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la-la-la-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la)
And I'll find you

[Outro]
Ready or not (ready or not) (woah, woah, oh, woah, oh)
(You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs)
Ready or not (here I come!) (woah, woah, oh, woah, oh)
Oh! Ready or not (ready or not, woo!)
Ready or not (ready or not, ready or not, boom-batta-boom, batta-boom, batta-boom, batta-boom)
Ready or not
