[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
You walk and talk like you're some new sensation
You move in circles, you don't need an invitation
You spend your money, you can't get no satisfaction
You play it right so you can get the right reaction

[Pre-Chorus]
It won't be long, my darlin'
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby?
All of the ones supposed to be there for

[Chorus]
You (You)
When you're falling down, the world starts spinnin' out
You (You)
When you're falling down, no, it's not all about
You (You)
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down

[Post-Chorus]
(When you're falling down, you're falling down, down)
(When you're falling down)

[Verse 2]
What's out of place when you look into the mirror?
The truth is blurry, but the lies are gettin' clearer
Your eyes are fixed, your smile is so elastic
You gave me roses, but they're all just made of plastic

[Pre-Chorus]
It won't be long, my darlin'
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby?
All of the ones supposed to be there for

[Chorus]
You (You)
When you're falling down, the world starts spinnin' out
You (You)
When you're falling down, no, it's not all about
You (You)
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down

[Post-Chorus]
Smile for the camera, everybody's lookin' at ya
Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya
Smile for the camera, camera, camera
Smile for the camera, who's gonna catch ya?

[Bridge]
(Ah, ah) You (You)
(Ah, ah)

[Chorus]
You (You)
When you're falling down, the world starts spinnin' out
You (You)
When you're falling down, no, it's not all about
You (You)
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down

[Outro]
Smile for the camera, everybody's lookin' at ya
Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya
