[THE TROUBLETONES]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[SANTANA with THE TROUBLETONES harmonizing]
You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone)
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

[BRITTANY]
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

[MERCEDES with THE TROUBLETONES]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[SANTANA with MERCEDES]
You heard that I was starting over with
Someone new
They told you I was moving on
Over you

[BRITTANY with THE TROUBLETONES]
You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging

[BRITTANY]
You try to break me, but you see

[MERCEDES with THE TROUBLETONES (THE TROUBLETONES)]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
(Stand a little taller)
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
(What doesn't kill you makes a) fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

(What doesn't kill you makes you) stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
(What doesn't kill you) makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone!

[SANTANA]
Thanks to you I've got a new thing started!

[MERCEDES]
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted!

[SANTANA]
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking about me!

[MERCEDES & SANTANA]
You know in the end
The day you left was just my beginning

[SANTANA]
In the end

[SANTANA (and MERCEDES) with THE TROUBLETONES, {MERCEDES}]
(What doesn't kill you makes you) stronger {Stronger!}
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a (fighter)
(Footsteps even lighter)
(Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone)

What doesn't kill you makes you (stronger, stronger!)
Just me, myself and I {Yeah!}
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little (Taller!)

[SANTANA with THE TROUBLETONES (MERCEDES), {BRITTANY}]
Doesn't mean I'm lonely (Brittany: What doesn't kill you) when I'm alone (No, not alone)
Stronger, stronger (Yeah)
Just me, my {What doesn't kill you} self and I (Yeah!)
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger (Stronger!)
Stand a little taller (Stronger!)
Doesn't mean I'm lonely {What doesn't kill you} when I'm alone (Not alone)

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
