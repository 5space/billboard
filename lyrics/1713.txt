[FINN]
Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

[BLAINE]
Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start

Runnin' in circles
Comin' up tails
Heads on the science apart

[SANTANA]
Nobody said it was easy

[BLAINE & FINN]
Itâ€™s such a shame for us to part

[SANTANA]
Nobody said it was easy

[BLAINE & FINN]
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

[KURT]
I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

[BRITTANY]
Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

[EMMA & WILL, (EMMA)]
(But) tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh, when I rush to the start

[FINN & RACHEL (with the Group)]
Runnin' in circles
Chasin' our tails
Comin' back as we are
(Nobody said it was easy)
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
(Nobody said it was easy)
No one ever said it would be so hard

[THE GROUP, (RACHEL)]
Aa-aa-ah (I'm goin' back to the start)

Nobody said it was easy
No, no, no, no (Yeah, oh whoa)
Nobody said it was easy
No, no, no, no (Nobody said it was easy)
Nobody said it was easy
No, no, no, no (No, oh)

[RACHEL with the Group]
Nobody said it was easy
