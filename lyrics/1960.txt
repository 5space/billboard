[Verse 1: Jason Aldean]
Well, I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care
That we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that’s how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain, baking in the sun
Don’t quit 'til the job gets done

[Chorus]
That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That’s the only way I know

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan & Jason Aldean]
That old red dirt, the first thing you learn
Is you don’t get nothing that you don’t earn
Humble pride I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it
The sun in our eyes and backs to the fences
We didn’t know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasn’t thinking ‘bout nothing but winning

[Chorus]
That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That’s the only way I know

[Bridge: Eric Church]
Maybe there’s another path that
Will get you there a little bit faster
But I’m sticking with the one inside of me

[Chorus]
That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That's the only way I

That’s the only way I know
But don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That's the only way I know

[Outro]
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know
The only way I know
Now get on it one time
