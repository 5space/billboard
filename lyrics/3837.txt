[Verse 1]
If you only knew
I'm hangin' by a thread, the web I spin for you
If you only knew
I'd sacrifice my beating heart before I'd lose you

[Pre-Chorus]
I still hold on to the letters
You returned, I swear I've lived and learned

[Chorus]
It's 4:03 and I can't sleep
Without you next to me I toss and turn like the sea
If I drown tonight, bring me back to life
Breathe your breath in me
The only thing that I still believe in is you
If you only knew

[Verse 2]
If you only knew
How many times I counted all the words that went wrong
If you only knew
How I refuse to let you go even when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't regret any days I spent
Nights we shared, or letters that I sent

[Chorus]
It's 4:03 and I can't sleep
Without you next to me I toss and turn like the sea
If I drown tonight, bring me back to life
Breathe your breath in me
The only thing that I still believe in is you
If you only knew
If you only knew

[Bridge]
I still hold on to the letters
You returned, you helped me live and learn

[Chorus]
It's 4:03 and I can't sleep
Without you next to me I toss and turn like the sea
If I drown tonight, bring me back to life
Breathe your breath in me
The only thing that I still
Believe in is you (If I drown tonight, bring me back to life)
Believe in is you (If I drown tonight, bring me back to life)
I still believe in you
If you only knew
