[THE WARBLERS]
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, so can't you see? (I love you)
How can I tell you about my loved one? (I love you)
Ah, you gave me more, you gave it all to me, so can't you see? (I love you)
How can I tell you about my loved one?

[BLAINE & (THE WARBLERS)]
You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs (Ooooh...)
But I look around me and I see it isn't so (Ooooh, no...)
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs (Ahhhh...)
And what's wrong with that? (What's wrong with that?)
I'd like to know (Like to, like to know...)
'Cause here I go ('Cause here I go...) again! (Ba-ba-ba-pa-rap-ba...)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS, (THE WARBLERS)]
I love you, (I love...)
I love you, (I love...)

[BLAINE & (THE WARBLERS)]
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, so can't you see? (Ba-pa-ba-pa...)
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see (Ba-pa-ba-pa...)

Love doesn't come in a minute, (Doesn't come in a minute...)
Sometimes it doesn't come at all, (Doesn't come at all...)
I only know that when I'm in it, (Only know when I'm in it...)
It isn't silly, (At all...)
No it isn't silly, (At all)
Love isn't silly at all, not at all

(Ba-pa-ba-pa-ra-ba-pa-ba-ra-ba-pa-pa...)
(Ooooh...)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS, (BLAINE)]

You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs (Ooooh...)
But I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh no (Ooooh...)
