[RACHEL & MERCEDES]
Yeah...
Yeah...
Oooh...
Ooh, ooh...
Ohhh...

[RACHEL]
Every single day, I walk down the street
I hear people say, "Baby," so sweet
Ever since puberty, everybody stares at me
Boys, girls, I can't help it, baby
So be kind and don't lose your mind
Just remember that I'm your baby

[MERCEDES]
Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be

[RACHEL]
And if you give a damn

[RACHEL & MERCEDES]
Take me baby or leave me

[RACHEL]
Take me baby or leave me

[MERCEDES]
A tiger in a cage can never see the sun
This diva needs her stage: Baby, let's have fun!
You are the one I choose
Folks would kill to fill your shoes
You love the limelight too, now, baby
So be mine and don't waste my time
Cryin', "Oh Honeybear, are you still my, my, my baby?"

[RACHEL]
Take me for what I am

[MERCEDES]
Who I was meant to be

[RACHEL & MERCEDES]
And if you give a damn
Take me baby or leave me

[MERCEDES]
No way can I be what I'm not

[RACHEL]
But hey, don't you want your girl hot?

[MERCEDES]
Don't fight, don't lose your head

[RACHEL]
Cause every night, who's in your bed?

[MERCEDES]
Who, who's in your bed?

[RACHEL]
Kiss, pookie...

That's it! The straw that breaks my back
I quit

[MERCEDES]
Unless you take it back

[RACHEL & MERCEDES]
Women, what is it about them?
Can't live with them or without them!

Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be (Who I was meant to be)
And if you give a damn (And if you give a damn, ya better)
Take me baby or leave me (Oh, take me baby or leave me)
Take me baby or leave me

Guess I'm leavin'...
I'm gone!
