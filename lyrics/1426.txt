[Verse 1]
Smooth
Like a Tennessee Walker
Just a walking on the water
You're smooth
Like a Sunday morning Elvis singing Gospel
It's a hell of a
Groove
Like the lines on her Mercury
Girl, you're put together perfectly

[Chorus]
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
That do me like you
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth

[Verse 2]
Like cat daddy driving a caddy from Cali, baby
You're smooth
Like young love buzzing
Off an Old Camp bottle by the
Moon
Blackberry jam, finger-licking
Off your hand flying out the window

[Chorus]
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody (There ain't nobody)
That do me like you (Do me like you)
The way you move that body (The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth (So smooth)
Smooth, smooth

[Bridge]
You're a stroke on the canvas
A brick road to Kansas
My little summer time jam (Jam, jam)

[Chorus]
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody (There ain't nobody)
That do me like you (Do me like you)
The way you move that body (The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth (So smooth)
Smooth, smooth (You so smooth)
Smooth
