[Verse 1]
Ooh, crazy's what they think about me
Ain't gonna stop 'cause they tell me so
'Cause 99 miles per hour baby
Is how fast that I like to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't keep up with my rhythm though they keep trying
Too quick for the lines they throw
I walk to the sound of my own drum
It goes, they go, we go, hey yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really mean it, mean it, so go
Gotta feel it, honey takes control
Really mean it, mean it

[Verse 2]
I wake up to the city of angels
To see my name headlining the coast
They say I'm a walking dreamer, baby
If I stop they would make the show

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't keep up with my rhythm though they keep trying
Too quick for the lines they throw
I walk to the sound of my own drum
It goes, they go, we go, hey yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really mean it, mean it, so go
Gotta feel it, body takes control
Really mean it, mean it

[Chorus]
Hey, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really mean it, mean it, so go
Gotta feel it, honey takes control
Really mean it, mean it

[Bridge]
Everybody walk
Everybody walk
Everybody walk, walk, walk

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really mean it, mean it, so go
Gotta feel it, body takes control
Really mean it, mean it

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really mean it, mean it, so go
Gotta feel it, honey takes control
Really mean it, mean it
