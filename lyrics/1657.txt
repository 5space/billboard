[RACHEL]
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through

[RACHEL & JESSE]
I didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

[EMMA & WILL]
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel

[RACHEL & JESSE]
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time

[FINN, SANTANA & RACHEL]
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

[RACHEL]
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast

[RACHEL & JESSE]
I've been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

[EMMA & WILL]
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold

[RACHEL & JESSE]
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

[FINN, JESSE, WILL, RACHEL, SANTANA, & EMMA (SANTANA)]
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time (Hey, yeah)
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

[FINN, JESSE, and WILL, (EMMA & RACHEL), ((SANTANA))]
Ooh (Woah)
Ooh ((Woah, oh, oh)) (Whoa)
Ooh ((Yeah, yeah, yeah)) (Whoa)
Ooh ((Woah-oh))

[SANTANA]
You're so fine and you're mine

[SANTANA & FINN]
I'll be yours till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

[FINN, JESSE, WILL, RACHEL & EMMA, (SANTANA)]
Like a virgin (You make me feel like a virgin)
Touched for the very first time (Oh, baby)

[FINN, JESSE, WILL, RACHEL, SANTANA, & EMMA]
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine
Like a virgin

[RACHEL & FINN, (SANTANA)]
Oh, like a virgin (Yeah)
Feels so good inside (So good inside)

[JESSE, (EMMA), FINN, {Santana}]
When you hold me (When you hold me)
When your heart beats (When your heart beats)
When you love me {When you love me, baby}

[RACHEL & FINN]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

[SANTANA]
Oh yeah
Oh

[FINN, JESSE, WILL, RACHEL, SANTANA, & EMMA, (SANTANA)]
(Oh) Like a virgin
