[Verse 1]
Traffic crawls
Cell phone calls
Talk radio screams at me
Through my tinted window I see
A little girl
A rust red minivan
She's got chocolate on her face
Got little hands

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And she waves at me
Yeah, she smiles at me

[Chorus]
Well, hello world, how ya been?
Good to see you my old friend
Sometimes I feel, cold as steel
Broken like I'm never gonna heal
I see a light, a little hope, in a little girl
Well, hello world

[Verse 2]
Every day I drive by
A little white church
It's got these little white crosses
Like angels in the yard
Maybe I should stop on in
Say a prayer
Maybe talk to God
Like he is there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh, I know he's there
Yeah, I know he's there

[Chorus]
Well, hello world, how ya been?
Good to see you my old friend
Sometimes I feel, as cold as steel
And broken like I'm never gonna heal
I see a light, a little grace, a little faith unfurl
Well, hello world

[Bridge]
Sometimes I forget what living's for
And I hear my life through my front door
And I'll be there, oh, I'm home again
I see my wife, my little boy, little girl
Hello world
Hello world

[Outro]
All the empty disappears
I remember why I'm here
Just surrender and believe
I fall down on my knees
Oh, hello world
Hello world
Hello world
