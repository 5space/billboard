[ARTIE]
Ooh huh, hoo..ooh

[FINN]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life

[ARTIE & FINN]
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference

[FINN]
Gonna make it right...

[PUCK]
As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind

[ARTIE & BLAINE]
I see the kids in the street

[BLAINE]
(With not enough to eat)

[ARTIE & BLAINE]
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

[SAM (with ARTIE and BLAINE)]
A summer's disre(gard)
A broken bottle (top)
And one man's soul

[ARTIE (with BLAINE)]
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
(Cause they got no where to go)
That's why I want you to know

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change

[ARTIE with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Nanana nanana nananana

[ARTIE]
Oh oh...

[BLAINE (with ARTIE)]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
(There are some with no home,)
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be, really me
(Pretending that they're not alone?)

[MIKE (with NEW DIRECTIONS)]
A willow deeply (scarred)
Somebody's broken (heart)
And a washed out dream

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Washed out dream...

[PUCK]
They follow the pattern of the wind you see

[PUCK with FINN]
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[FINN with ARTIE and (NEW DIRECTIONS)]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (You)
I'm asking him to change his ways (You)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (You)
I'm asking him to change his ways (You)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Change!

[ARTIE & FINN, ((New Directions))]
I'm starting with the (man in the mirror) ((Oh yeah))
I'm asking him to change his ways ((Just change))
And no message could have been any clearer ((Ooh ooh))

[MIKE with NEW DIRECTIONS, (ARTIE)]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change (Come on!)
You got to get it right, while you got the time (Wooooo!)
'Cause when you close your heart, (You can't), then you close your
(Close your, your mind) mind!

[FINN and NEW DIRECTIONS]
I'm starting with the (man in the mirror) (Oh yeah) (That man, that man, that man)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Just change) (Artie: That man, that man, that man, that man, You know, that man)
And no message (Could have been any clearer)
(Ooh ooh)

[ARTIE and FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change

[PUCK]
