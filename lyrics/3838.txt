[Verse 1]
I painted your room at midnight
So I'd know yesterday was over
I put all your books on the top shelf
Even the one with the four-leaf clover
Man, I'm gettin' older

[Verse 2]
I took all your pictures off the wall
And wrapped them in a newspaper blanket
I haven't slept in what seems like a century
And now I can barely breathe

[Chorus]
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were gettin' high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away
I guess I was just a little too late

[Verse 3]
Your words still serenade me
Your lullabies won't let me sleep
I've never heard such a haunting melody
Oh, it's killin' me
You know I can barely breathe

[Chorus]
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were gettin' high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away
I guess I was just a little too late

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were gettin' high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away

[Chorus]
Like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were gettin' high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away
I guess I was just a little too late

[Outro]
Just a little too late
