[BRITTANY & (ARTIE)]
Wake up in the morning
Feelin' like P. Diddy (Hey, what up, girl?)
Grab my glasses
I'm out the door
I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go!)
Before I leave
Brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night
I ain't coming back

[BRITTANY (with NEW DIRECTIONS)]
I'm talking pedicure on our (Toes, toes)
Tryin' on all our (Clothes, clothes)

Drop-topping, playing our favorite (CD's)
Pulling up to the (Parties)
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

And now the dudes are lining up
'Cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb
Unless they look like Mick Jagger
