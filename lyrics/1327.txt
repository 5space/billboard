[Intro]
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

[Verse 1]
I've seen the Joshua Tree
Got down on my knees
Threw the Virgin Mother a prayer
I've walked glass barefooted
Strolled 'cross the devil's hot coals
I've tried everything, I swear

[Chorus]
Oh, but hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

[Post-Chorus]
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

[Verse 2]
Fortuneteller told me
"No more last chances
You got no future at all"
Oh, but I ain't listenin'
You black-hearted gypsy
With a crucifix through her bedroom wall

[Chorus]
Hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm a half-cock, full-tilt, scarred-hands-to-the-hilt
Don't-push-me grown-ass man
Yeah, flashin' light caution, careful where ya cross son
'Til she comes back again

[Chorus]
Yeah, hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
Oh, hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man
Oh, hey (hey) I said hey (hey)
Woah, what can I say? I'm a desperate man
Oh, hey (hey) I said hey (hey)
I'm just a desperate man

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Grown-ass man
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

[Outro]
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
