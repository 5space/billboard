[ARTIE]
Oh yeah
Watch it, ooh!
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
And aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away and make it OK
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain
And it goes like this

[ARTIE with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS (NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS)]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (But it's alright)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you (But it's alright)
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

I don't need to try to control you (But it's alright)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you (But it's alright)
With them moves like Jagger (Now)
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

[ARTIE]
Maybe it's hard when you feel like you're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me, I'll make you believe
That I've got the key

So get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Like this

[ARTIE with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS (NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS)]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (But it's alright)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you (But it's alright)
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

I don't need to try to control you (But it's alright)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you (But it's alright)
With them moves like Jagger (Now)
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain (Moves like Jagger)
But it's all right (Now)

[ARTIE]
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas
And it goes like this
