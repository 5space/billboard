[Verse 1]
Well, baby love's just one of them words that gets thrown around
Like a Jack and Coke, sitting on the bar, it gets watered down
So I ain't gonna say it, no I ain't gonna lie
If you want to known the truth, how I feel about you tonight

[Chorus]
If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down

[Verse 2]
So baby let me look at you and see just what I got
If you were my cherry stem I'd tie you in a knot
And if I could inhale you, oh baby I'd be gone
I'd be floating round high as the Colorado sky blowing smoke rings all night long

[Chorus]
If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down

Last call, last chance
Last dance I was ever gonna get to take

[Chorus]
If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down
Then I'd shoot ya down

[Outro]
If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
