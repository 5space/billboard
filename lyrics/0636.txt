(Oh) Turn up the music, let's get out on the floor
I like to move it, come and give me some more
Watch me getting physical, out of control (Aha)
There's people watching me (Aha), I never miss a beat

Still the night, kill the lights, feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight 'cause it's pulling you in
Wrap it up, you can't stop 'cause it feels like an overdose (Feels like an overdose)

(Oho, oho) Evacuate the dancefloor
(Oho, oho) I'm infected by the sound
(Oho, oho) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, mr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Everybody in the club) (Oho, oho) Evacuate the dancefloor
(Oho, oho) I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club) (Oho, oho) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, mr. DJ, come burn this place right down to the ground

(Oh) My body's aching, system overload
Temperature's rising, I'm about to explode
Watch me I'm intoxicated, taking the show (Aha)
It`s got me hypnotized (Aha), everybody step aside

Still the night, kill the lights, feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight 'cause it's pulling you in
Wrap it up, you can't stop 'cause it feels like an overdose (Feels like an overdose)

(Oho, oho) Evacuate the dancefloor
(Oho, oho) I'm infected by the sound
(Oho, oho) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, mr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Everybody in the club) (Oho, oho) Evacuate the dancefloor
(Oho, oho) I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club) (Oho, oho) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, mr. DJ, come burn this place right down to the ground

(Come on and evacuate, feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate, push it to the top
Come on and evacuate, feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate, you don't have to be afraid)

(Now guess who's back with a brand new track?
They got everybody in the club going mad
So everybody in the back
Get your back up off the wall and just shake that thang)

(Go crazy, yo, lady, yo, baby
Let me see you wreck that thang
Now drop it down low, low
Let me see you take it to the dancefloor, yo)

(Everybody in the club) Evacuate the dancefloor
(Everybody in the club) I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, mr. DJ, let the music take me underground

(Oho, oho) Evacuate the dancefloor
(Oho, oho) I'm infected by the sound
(Oho, oho) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, mr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Everybody in the club) (Oho, oho) Evacuate the dancefloor
(Oho, oho) I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club) (Oho, oho) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, mr. DJ, come burn this place right down to the ground
