[Intro]
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Yeah
Ooh-oh-oh
O-oh-oh
O-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I've been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours for what
Oh, tell me what I got
I get this feeling
Times just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

[Chorus]
Tonight I got to cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut loose

[Verse 2]
You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Deep way down in your heart
You're burning yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life arenâ€™t passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You'll get by if you'd only

[Chorus]
Cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
O-wee Marie, shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo, come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut loose

[Bridge]
Ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Ooh

[Verse 3]
We've got to turn you around
And put your feet on the ground
Now take a hold of your soul

I'm turning it loose

[Chorus]
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut loose
(Footloose) footloose

[Chorus]
Kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut

[Outro]
(Everybody) everybody cut loose
