(Anybody find me somebody to love?)

[RACHEL]
Ohhh...
Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet (Take a look at yourself in the mirror)

[FINN]
Take a look in the mirror and cry (And cry, yeah yeah)
Lord, what you're doing to me!

[RACHEL]
I've spent all my years believing you (Oooh, believing you)
But I just can't get no relief (But I just can't get no relief)

I work hard everyday of my life (He works hard)

I work 'til I ache in my bones!
At the end (At the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own (Goes home, goes home on his own)

[RACHEL]
I get down on my knees and I start to pray (Down, knees, praise the Lord!)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes (Oooh...)

But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy

[ARTIE]
(Ahhh...) They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense, I got nobody left to believe
(He's got nobody left to believe)
No... (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[FINN & RACHEL]
Oh somebody, oh somebody (Oooh, Lord, somebody, somebody)
Can anybody find me...

[RACHEL]

[FINN]
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (You just keep losing it)

[RACHEL]
I'm ok, I'm alright (Yeah, he's alright, he's alright, yeah yeah)
I ain't gonna face no defeat

[FINN & RACHEL]
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord! (Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord!)
