[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
You actin' like you hate me (Hate me, yeah)
Where is your love?
You do too much complaining (Complaining, yeah)
Where is your trust? (Trust, trust)

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & Trippie Redd]
Flyin’ in a Wraith, yeah
Pass by time through the day, yeah (Skrrt)
Blinded with hate, yeah
I ain't got time for the chase, yeah
Just me and my bae, yeah
Wan' shop, get the racks out the safe, yeah
We gon’ party too late, yeah
Do the dash in the whip on the jakes, yeah (Skrrt)

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Ice tray, diamonds on froze, get a migraine
Life on the edge, live it up on the high lane
Me and Trippie Redd back to back on the same thing
Late night, turnt in the club doing my thing
Sip drank, get a cup, I'ma pour the whole thing
Shawty playin' games, she don't wanna sell her soul, man
Sayin' that she love me, but I'm knowing that she don't, man
Playing back and forth, probably thinking that I'm dumb, man

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Nigga, I ain’t worried ’bout a bitch, nigga, worry 'bout a check (Worry ’bout a bitch, nigga, worry 'bout a check)
Nigga, VVS diamonds, lil' nigga, had to flex (Them VVS diamonds, young nigga had to flex)
Nigga hoppin' out the ’Rari, then I'm hoppin' in the jet (Then I'm hoppin' out the 'Rari, then I'm hoppin' on the plane)
Bad lil' bitch all on my dick, I want the neck, ayy
She want the dick, I don't want sex, I want the neck, ayy (I want the neck)
Me and YoungBoy tossing these hoes, we want the neck, ayy (And we want the neck)

[Verse 3: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & Trippie Redd]
Whole full moon in the middle of the day
I done jumped out my sleep, heard the phone go ring
Back to back, we be flippin' these hoes on a train
Keep a pole, we never be playin' no games (Bah)
Diamonds gon' shine, put an eight on my chain (Yeah)
I done ran up that money, stayed true to the gang
Diamonds, they shining, that's all through the rain
Through all the mud and through all the pain (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Actin' like you hate me (Hate me)
Where is your love? (Where is your love? Yeah)
You do too much complaining (Too much complaining)
Where is your trust? (Where is your trust? Yeah)

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & Trippie Redd]
Flyin' in a Wraith, yeah
Pass by time through the day, yeah (Skrrt)
Blinded with hate, yeah
I ain't got time for the chase, yeah
Just me and my bae, yeah
Wan' shop, get the racks out the safe, yeah
We gon' party too late, yeah
Do the dash in the whip on the jakes, yeah
