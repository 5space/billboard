Pants on the ground! Pants on the ground!

[Hook]
Lookin' like a fool witcha pants on the ground!
With the gold in your mouth, hat turned sideways
Pants hit the ground, call yourself a cool cat

[Verse]
Lookin like a fool, walkin' downtown
With ya pants on the ground!
Giddy up
Hey, get ya pants off the ground, lookin' like a fool
Walkin', talkin', wit ya pants on the ground!
Giddy up!
Hey, get ya pants off the ground!

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Lookin like a fool, walk, talkin'
With ya pants on the ground!
Boom! Whoa! Yes!

[Hook]
