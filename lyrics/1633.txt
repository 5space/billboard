[QUINN]
I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty, too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there?
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, hey

[RACHEL]
My outsides are cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I've tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just tripping

[QUINN & RACHEL]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow

[QUINN]
You can fix your nose if he says so (Aahh)

[QUINN & RACHEL]
You can buy all the makeup that M.A.C. can make
But if you can't look inside you

[QUINN]
Find out who am I to (Aah)

[QUINN & RACHEL]
Be in a position to make me feel so

[RACHEL]
Damn unpretty

[QUINN]
I feel pretty

[RACHEL]
Oh, so pretty

[QUINN & RACHEL]
I feel pretty and witty and bright

[RACHEL]
Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm being stupid
I used to be so cute to me

[RACHEL & QUINN]
Just a little bit skinny

[QUINN]
Why do I look to all these things

[QUINN & RACHEL]
(To keep you happy?)

[RACHEL]
Maybe get rid of you
And then I'll get back to me, hey

[QUINN]
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you

[RACHEL]
I've tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day, I have myself to blame
Keep on tripping

[RACHEL & QUINN]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow

[QUINN]
You can fix your nose if he says so (Aahh)

[RACHEL & QUINN]
You can buy all the makeup that M.A.C. can make
But if you can't look inside you

[QUINN]
Find out who am I to (Aahh)

[RACHEL & QUINN]
Be in a position to make me feel so

[RACHEL]
Damn unpretty

[QUINN]
I feel pretty

[RACHEL]
Oh, so pretty

[QUINN & RACHEL]
I feel pretty and witty and bright

[QUINN]
And I pity

[RACHEL]
Any girl who isn't me

[RACHEL & (QUINN)]
Tonight (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
Tonight (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
Tonight (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
Tonight (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

I feel pretty (You can buy your hair if it won't grow)
Oh, so pretty (You can fix your nose if he says so)
I feel pretty and witty and bright (You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make, but if)

[QUINN & RACHEL]
You can't look inside you

[QUINN]
Find out who am I to (Aahh)

[QUINN & RACHEL]
Be in a position to make me feel so

[RACHEL]
Damn unpretty

[QUINN & RACHEL]
I feel pretty
(But unpretty)
