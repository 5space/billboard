And I'm losing control
Cause the power you're supplying
It's electrifying

Cause I need a man (Doo doo doo, doo doo doo)
And my heart is set on you (And my heart is set on you)
You better shape up (Doo doo doo)
You better understand (Doo doo doo, doo doo doo)
To my heart I must be true (Doo doo doo)

Meditate in my direction
