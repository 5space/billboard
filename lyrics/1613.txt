[RACHEL]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

[RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS (SANTANA)]
To fly
To fly (Uh, yo, yo)

[ARTIE]
I used to think that I could not go on

[SANTANA]
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away

[ARTIE]
And life was nothing but an awful song

[SANTANA (NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS)]
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me (If I can see it)

[BLAINE & (NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS)]
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends (Then I can do it)
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood (If I just believe it)
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising (There's nothing to it)

[BLAINE & SANTANA]
I win, thrive, soar
Higher, higher, higher
More fire

[RACHEL & SANTANA (RACHEL)]
(I came to win), to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS (RACHEL & NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS)]
I believe I can fly (Fly)
I believe I can touch the sky
I believe I can fly (Fly)
I believe I can touch the sky

[ARTIE]
See, I was on the verge of breaking down

[SANTANA]
Paint they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins

[ARTIE]
Sometimes silence can seem so loud

[SANTANA (NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS)]
I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined (If I can see it)

[BLAINE (NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS)]
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near (Then I can do it)
See we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfickle time to spare (If I just believe it)
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me (There's nothing to it)

[BLAINE & SANTANA]
But when you go hard your nays become yays
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

[RACHEL and SANTANA (RACHEL)]
(I came to win), to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS (RACHEL and NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS), {MERCEDES}]
I believe I can fly (Fly) {Fly}
I believe I can touch the sky {Ooh-ooh, uh, yeah}
I believe I can fly (Fly)
I believe I can touch the sky {Fly}

[FINN & (MERCEDES)]
I believe I can fly (Fly)

[ARTIE (RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS)]
(Get ready for it, get ready for it) Then I can be it
(Get ready for it, I came to win) If I just believe it
(Get ready for it, get ready for it) There's nothing to it

[MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS]
Get ready for it

[ARTIE & NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS (RACHEL & NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS), {MERCEDES}]
I believe I can fly (Fly) {Ooh-ooh}

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS (RACHEL and NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS), {MERCEDES}]
I believe I can touch the sky {Fly}
I think about it every night and day (Fly) {Oh}
Spread my wings and fly away {Ooh, whoa}

[ARTIE & NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS (RACHEL & NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS), {MERCEDES}, NEW DIRECTIONS]
(I can fly) I believe I can soar (Fly) {Get ready for it}
(I can fly) I see me runnin' through that open door {Get ready for it, fly}

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS (RACHEL & NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS), {NEW DIRECTIONS}, ARTIE, MERCEDES]
{I can fly} I believe I can fly (Fly) (Woo) (Get ready for it)

[ARTIE & (NEW DIRECTIONS)]

[ARTIE with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS (and GIRLS)]
I believe I can (Fly)
