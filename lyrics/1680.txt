[RACHEL]
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it; baby, stay with me
Love the game intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I'll get him hot, and show him what I've got
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I'll get him hot, and show him what I've got

[SHELBY]
Can't read my
Can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

[RACHEL]
She's got to love nobody

[SHELBY]
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face

[RACHEL & SHELBY]
She's got to love nobody

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face

[SHELBY]
I wanna roll with him
A hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And, baby, when it's love, if it ain't rough, it isn't fun

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot and show him what I've got

[SHELBY & RACHEL]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh, I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got
Can't read my

[RACHEL]
Can't read my

[SHELBY & RACHEL]
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody

[SHELBY (with RACHEL)]
I won't tell you that (I love you)
Kiss or (hug you)
Cause I'm (bluffin') with my (muffin)
I'm not (lyin')
I'm just (stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin')

[RACHEL]
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out

[SHELBY]
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I am marvelous
I'm marvelous

[RACHEL]
I'm marvelous

[SHELBY & RACHEL]
I'm marvelous
So marvelous

She's got to love nobody
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
