[Intro]
Alright

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's been a bumpy road
Roller coasters high and low
Fill the tank and drive the car
Pedal fast, pedal hard
You won't have to go that far

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna give up 'cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart

[Chorus]
So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done, you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what, you'll never be alone
Never be alone (Oh-oh)
Never be alone (Oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Forgot directions on your way
Don't close your eyes, don't be afraid
We might be crazy late at night
I can't wait 'til you arrive
Follow stars; you'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna give up 'cause it's dark (Hey)
We're really not that far apart

[Chorus]
So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done, you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what, you'll never be alone
Never be alone (Oh-oh)
Never be alone (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna give up 'cause it's dark (Dark, dark, dark)
We're really not that far apart

[Chorus]
So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done, you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what, you'll never be alone
Never be alone (Oh-oh)
Never be alone (Oh-oh)

[Outro]
When it's all said and done, you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what, you'll never be alone
