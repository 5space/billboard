[Intro: All]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1: Calum]
Counting down these seconds
Jumping off these fences
Find another place to start again
The cracks in the sidewalk
I'm over all the small talk
Taking off like fire in the wind

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away
Running, we're not looking back

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I want a little bit of California
With a little bit of London sky
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away tonight
I want a little bit of open ocean
With a New York state of mind
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away, fly away tonight
Fly away tonight
Fly away tonight

[Verse 2: Michael]
A never ending replay
With memories I can't erase
I see the best of times in front of me
Now I'm off to paradise
To a war I'll never fight
Say goodbye to pain and misery

[Pre-Chorus: Michael]
I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away
Running, we're not looking back

[Chorus: All]
I want a little bit of California
With a little bit of London sky
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away tonight
I want a little bit of open ocean
With a New York state of mind
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away, fly away tonight

[Bridge: Luke & Calum]
I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away
I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away
Counting down the seconds
Always second guessing
I'm dreaming of a place to start again

[Chorus: All]
I want a little bit of California
With a little bit of London sky
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away tonight
I want a little bit of open ocean
With a New York state of mind
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away, fly away tonight
Fly away tonight
Fly away tonight

[Outro: All]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
