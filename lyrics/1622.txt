[KURT, (RACHEL)]
Forget your troubles (Happy days)
Come on, get happy (Are here again)
You better chase all your cares away (The skies above are clear again)
Shout hallelujah (So let's sing a song)
Come on, get happy (Of cheer again)
Get ready for the judgement day (Happy days are here again)
The sun is shining
Come on get happy (Shout it now)
The lord is waiting to take your hand (There is no one who can doubt it now)
Shout hallelujah (So lets tell the world)
And just get happy (About it now)
We are going to the promise land (Happy days are here again)
We're heading across the river
Soon your cares will all be gone

[RACHEL]
There'll be no more from now on

[KURT & RACHEL]
From now on

[KURT, (RACHEL)]
Forget your troubles (Oh, happy days)
And just get happy (Are here again)
You better chase all your blues away (The skies above are clear again)
Shout hallelujah (So lets sing a song)
And just get happy (Of cheer again)

[RACHEL, (KURT)]
Happy times (Happy times)
Happy nights (Happy nights)

[KURT & RACHEL]
Happy days are here again
