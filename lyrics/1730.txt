[RACHEL]
Guess this means you're sorry
You're standin' at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
You said you'd never come back
But here you are again

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you

[RACHEL]
Maybe I was stupid for tellin' you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for tryna pick a fight

[FINN & RACHEL]
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out
I'm nothing without you

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you

[TINA]
Being with you is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you

[MERCEDES & TINA]
But I can't let you go, yeah

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Lalalalalala, lalalalala
Lalalalalala, lalalalala...

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you
