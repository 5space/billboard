[Verse 1]
Every morning when you come downstairs
Hair's a mess but I don't care
No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right

Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross out finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

[Chorus]
You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

[Verse 2]
Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by us so fast

[Chorus]
You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna sing it again

[Chorus]
You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy
Easy
Easy
