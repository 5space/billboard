[Verse 1]
I remember where we used to dance
Out by the well, under the moon
You were begging me for half a chance
Summer was gone, we were in bloom

[Pre-Chorus]
Just two kids with pockets full of pennies
Singing every wish to our own melody

[Chorus]
Oh my love
Tell me is it wrong
Swaying to this song
Holding memories of you
Oh, I'll be fine
If I could forget
Don't you think I would
Wish to god I could
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you

[Verse 2]
I never knew the stars could be so bright
Under the blanket, over the moon

[Pre-Chorus]
Something more than words, your heart was telling me
Everything word you whispered was a melody



[Excluded from Music Video]
[Chorus]
Oh my love
Tell me is it wrong
Swaying to this song
Holding memories of you
Oh, I'll be fine
If I could forget
Oh, don't you think I would
Wish to god I could
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you

[Bridge]
Oh, I wish I didn't know
Oh, how could it be
And that it could break so easily
I guess I could say it wasn't me
[Chorus]
Oh, but it was
And I know it's wrong
Swaying to this song
Holding memories of you
No, I try
And if I could forget
Oh, don't you think I would
Wish to god I could
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you
