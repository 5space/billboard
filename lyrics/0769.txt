[Intro]
You know
Tonight I'm feeling a little out of control
Is this me?
You wanna get crazy?
'Cause I don't give a... (Ow!)

[Verse 1]
I'm out of character
I'm in rare form
And if you really knew me
You know it's not the norm
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone, I feel brand new
And if you don't like it, fuck you

[Pre-Chorus]
The music's on and I'm dancing (Hey)
I'm normally in the corner just standing (Hey)
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care 'cause this my night

[Chorus]
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

[Verse 2]
I'm dancing a lot, I'm taking shots and I'm feeling fine
I'm kissing all the boys and the girls
Someone call the doctor 'cause I lost my mind
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone, I feel brand new
And if you don't like it, fuck you

[Pre-Chorus]
The music's on and I'm dancing (Hey)
I'm normally in the corner just standing (Hey)
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care 'cause this my night

[Chorus]
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl (Oh)
I'm not myself tonight (Yeah, yeah)
Tonight I'm not the same girl

[Bridge]
In the morning (Oh)
When I wake up (Oh)
I'll go back to the girl I used to be
But, baby, not tonight

[Chorus]
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl (Oh)
I'm not myself tonight (Yeah, yeah)
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

[Outro]
Yeah, that feels good
I needed that, yeah
Get crazy
Let's go, yeah
That's right, come on
Uhh, yeah
Give it to me now
Don't stop
Uh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah
