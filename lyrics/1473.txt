[Intro: Renz]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Chorus: Renz & Lil Sosho]
Walk up in dat bit' too clean, I’m froze (Froze)
They don’t fight you where I’m from
Like the beat, I keep a drum
You ain’t got dough lil' boy, you a bum (Ayy)
She gave me brain that bit' so dumb (So dumb)
Used to be broke, I ain’t have no funds
Now I spend it just for fun
Eat at Harold’s just for lunch (Ayy)
Walk up in dis bitch wit da VVS
Can’t get my 'Gram 'cause I don’t do the text
Don’t give a damn 'bout how you flex
Pull up with cubans all over my neck
Tec gon' blam don’t care who next
See me and kinfolk, you see three vets
I’m at the show, better have my check
Choppa gon' blow if you disrespect us

[Verse 1: Renz]
Choppa gon' blow if you disrespect
Lotta bad bitches wanna give me sex
Gang on my neck, gold chain wit da crest
She gon' buss it down on a boy then I dip
You a lil' bitch crying 'bout some creds
Had a drop a roll and I got some breads
Renz gon' eat, whole gang get fed
Hatin on me? Lil' boy get slept (Slept)

[Verse 2: Lil Sosho]
Hatin' on me? Lil' boy get slept
I ain’t even really gotta call my gang
Got a 30 on me so I’m by myself
Shorty wanna know if I dress myself
Cheated on her man like I gave her health
Told me go deep like a wishing well
Hit it one time then you know I bailed (Uh)
Diamonds shinin' on 'em can’t control 'em
I be wit' a pretty bitch, she from California
I asked my lawyer, "What they do if I don’t show up?"
Lil So got his dough up, got no Ls and picked yo ho up

[Chorus: Renz & Lil Sosho]
Walk up in dat bit' too clean, I’m froze (Froze)
They don’t fight you where I’m from
Like the beat, I keep a drum
You ain’t got dough lil' boy, you a bum (Ayy)
She gave me brain that bit' so dumb (So dumb)
Used to be broke, I ain’t have no funds
Now I spend it just for fun
Eat at Harold’s just for lunch (Ayy)
Walk up in dis bitch wit da VVS
Can’t get my 'Gram 'cause I don’t do the text
Don’t give a damn 'bout how you flex
Pull up with cubans all over my neck
Tec gon' blam don’t care who next
See me and kinfolk, you see three vets
I’m at the show, better have my check
Choppa gon blow if you disrespect us

[Verse 3: Kang]
Wok up in that bih too clean I’m froze
Hers in silver, mine in gold
Never had shit so da bag I'ma blow
FRVR that's spelled no E’s, no O’s
She love da drip, so I got in the mix
Kick out the broad , 'cause we can’t trust a bitch
Yeah I said “we”, 'cause it’s me and my bitch
Nun' personal, man, it’s just bidness
Picked up a mic, it was easy as shit
I make more bread off the wok and the pics
Thought I was on, but they ain’t seen shit
Deadshot flow, 'cause a nigga really don't miss
(Knick) Knack, patti wack
Here comes Kang wit da same ol' pack (Nigga don't miss)
I ain’t talkin gas 'cause I don’t do dat
But I’m talkin 'bout my niggas that’ll come through stat
Wait who? 'Dem niggas rap?
Money in the bank, I ain’t talkin' 'bout a match
Lookin' for da KANG, I'ma be where I'm at
I’m just making Ms, muhfucker dats dat
Dytto on my side like a muhfuckin' catch phrase
Switch lanes, I'ma need da bag on sight 'fore we hit stage
Niggas actin goofy in the slotty, we gon' engage
Wok up in the bih kickin' shit like a sensei

[Chorus: Renz & Lil Sosho]
Walk up in dat bit' too clean, I’m froze (Froze)
They don’t fight you where I’m from
Like the beat, I keep a drum (Ayy)
You ain’t got dough lil' boy, you a bum
She gave me brain that bit' so dumb
Used to be broke, I ain’t have no funds
Now I spend it just for fun
Eat at Harold’s just for lunch (Ayy)
Walk up in dis bitch wit da VVS
Can’t get my 'Gram 'cause I don’t do the text
Don’t give a damn 'bout how you flex
Pull up with cubans all over my neck
Tec gon' blam don’t care who next
See me and kinfolk, you see three vets
I’m at the show, better have my check
Choppa gon blow if you disrespect us
