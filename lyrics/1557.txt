[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality
Open your eyes look up to the skies and see

[JESSE]
I'm just a poor boy

[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Poor boy

[JESSE]
I need no sympathy

[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, Little low

[JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter

[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
To me

[JESSE]
To me

[JESSE (with VOCAL ADRENALINE)]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
(Mama, ooh) didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
(Carry on, carry on)
As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, (Ooh) (Anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die

[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)

[JESSE (with VOCAL ADRENALINE)]
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[JESSE]
I see a little silhouetto of a man

[JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango?

[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Thunderbolts and lightning very very frightening me

[VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS & (JESSE)]
Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo (Galileo)
(Galileo Figaro)

[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Magnifico-o-o-o

[JESSE]
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me

[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

[JESSE]
Easy come, easy go
Will you let me go?

[VOCAL ADRENALINE BOYS]
Bismillah!
No, we will not let you go

[VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS]
Let him go

[JESSE]
Bismillah! We will not let you go

[VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS]
Let him go

[JESSE]
Bismillah! We will not let you go

[VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS]
Let me go

[JESSE]
Let me go-o-o-o-o
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Will not let you go

[VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS]
(Let me go)

[JESSE]
Never let you go

[VOCAL ADRENALINE GIRLS]
(Let me go)

[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
O-o-o-o-o
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

[JESSE]
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia

[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has the devil put aside for me, for me, for me

[JESSE]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here

[VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[JESSE]
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters, to me

[JESSE with VOCAL ADRENALINE]
Anyway the wind blows
