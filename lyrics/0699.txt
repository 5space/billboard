[Intro]
Tha Biz, Tha Bizness

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
T-Take it off, I wanna love you
And errybody wanna touch you
You movin' right, wanna see what's up under
You back it up, beep beep like a trucker
N-Nice thighs, nice waist
And you know I can't forget about your face
But don't none of that matter
I'm about to make your pockets fatter

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Girl, I just wanna see you strip
Right now 'cause it's late, babe
Girl, I just wanna see you strip (Oh, oh, oh)
Girl, take your time with it
Girl, I just wanna see you strip
Goddamn, you sexy, for me (Oh-oh)
Goddamn, you sexy, baby (Oh-oh)
Goddamn, you sexy (Oh-oh)
Girl, I just wanna see you⁠—

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Got my shades on, with my Js on
In the club with a pocket full of ones
This girl booty outta control
There she go, up and down the pole
Which one I'ma take home? (Take home) Get my freak on (Freak on)
If you ain't freakin', we ain't speakin'
Think I'm playing? No, I'm not
Let me see you back it up and drop
Yeah, I wanna see your legs in the air
Baby, don't worry about your hair
All those tracks
I don't give a damn 'bout that
In the club, they play my song
Turn it up, play it all night long
If you think you can and you know you can
I'ma give you all this money, money, money

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Girl, I just wanna see you strip
Right now 'cause it's late, babe
Girl, I just wanna see you strip (Oh, oh, oh)
Girl, take your time with it
Girl, I just wanna see you strip
Goddamn, you sexy, for me (Oh-oh)
Goddamn, you sexy, baby (Oh-oh)
Goddamn, you sexy (Oh-oh)
Girl, I just wanna see you⁠—

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Pants (Pants), shirt (Shirt), you could take it off (Off)
Panties (Pantie), bra (Bra), you could take it off (Off)
Red-bottom heels, you could take 'em, wait, wait
Leave 'em on 'cause I like my women tall
Y-Y-You got a hot mama (Mama), you're hotter than a sauna (Sauna)
I want to peel them clothes off your body like a banana (Like a banana)
The only reason I dress you in that designer (Why you do that?)
Is to get you out that Dolce & Gabbana (Ah)
I throw this money up (Up), she watch it all fall (Fall)
Toot that thang up (Up), p-pop it for a boss
Anything you wanting, baby, you can have it all
Starting with my last name, now they call you Mrs. McCall (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Girl, I just wanna see you strip
Right now 'cause it's late, babe
Girl, I just wanna see you strip (Oh, oh, oh)
Girl, take your time with it
Girl, I just wanna see you strip
Goddamn, you sexy, for me (Oh-oh)
Goddamn, you sexy, baby (Oh-oh)
Goddamn, you sexy (Oh-oh)
Girl, I just wanna see you⁠—
