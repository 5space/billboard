[Intro: Rebecca Black]
Oh my god, I love this song
This is my jam
Where is my peanut butter?

[Verse 1: Rebecca Black]
2 PM, getting out of my bed
Trying to get Friday out of my head
It's all so hazy
Got a little too crazy
You know I'd do it all again

[Pre-Chorus: Rebecca Black]
Call everyone you know
Turn up the radio
'Cause this is our song
We can do no wrong
Are you ready, are you ready to go?

[Chorus: Rebecca Black]
This Saturday, we're gonna party all night
One we will remember the rest of our lives
This Saturday, we're gonna do it bigger than
We ever have before
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end

[Interlude: Rebecca Black & (Dave Days)]
(Hello?)
Hey, come over
(Alright, alright, I'll be right over
I just gotta find my pants.)

[Verse 2: Dave Days]
Rolling up, I'm on the scene
Want you here right next to me
Yeah, 'cause this is our night
Ain't got no deadlines
There's nowhere else I'd rather be

[Pre-Chorus: Rebecca Black]
Call everyone you know
Turn up the radio
'Cause this is our song
We can do no wrong
Are you ready, are you ready to go?

[Chorus: Rebecca Black]
This Saturday, we're gonna party all night
One we will remember the rest of our lives
This Saturday, we're gonna do it bigger than
We ever have before
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to...

[Bridge: Rebecca Black]
Yesterday was Friday
Today is Saturday
We're gonna live like there's no tomorrow
Wouldn't have it any other way

[Bridge: Rebecca Black]
Yesterday was Friday (Friday)
Today is Saturday (Saturday)
We're gonna live like there's no tomorrow
Wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus: Rebecca Black & Dave Days]
This Saturday, we're gonna party all night
One we will remember the rest of our lives
This Saturday, we're gonna do it bigger than
We ever have before
I don't want this Saturday to end
(Saturday, Saturday, Saturday)
I don't want this Saturday to end
(Saturday, Saturday, Saturday)
I don't want this Saturday to end

[Outro: Rebecca Black & Dave Days]
This Saturday, we're gonna party all night
All night, all night
I don't want this Saturday to end
This Saturday, we're gonna party all night
All night, all night
I don't want this Saturday to end
