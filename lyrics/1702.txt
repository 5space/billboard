[FINN & PUCK with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS]
Here we go!

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS, {NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS}]
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart {Free your mind}
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart
Think it over

[ARTIE (with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS)]
I wear tight clothing, high heeled shoes
It doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute (No, no)

[PUCK (with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS)]
I like rap music, wear hip hop clothes
That doesn't mean that I'm out sellin' dope (no no, no)

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS, {NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS}]
Before you can read me you gotta
Learn how to see me, I said
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart {Free your mind}
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart
Think it over

[PUCK with FINN & NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS, (FINN)]
Free your mind and the rest will follow (Think it over)
Be color blind, don't be so shallow

[SAM]
I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS, {ARTIE}]
Before you can read me you gotta
Learn how to see me, I said
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart {Can't stop! Can't stop!}
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart {Before you break my heart and stop!}
Think it over

[PUCK with FINN & NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS, (FINN), {ARTIE}]
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
(Think it over) Free your mind and the rest will follow {Oohh, oh-oh-oh}
Be color blind, don't be so shallow {Don't break my, don't break my heart}

[NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS, (ARTIE)]
Stop!
Stop! (In the name of love)
Free your mind
Stop!
Free your mind
Stop! (Oh free your mind)

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS]
Before you can read me you gotta
Learn how to see me, I said

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS, (ARTIE)]
Stop! (Stop!) In the name of love, before you break my heart (Before you break my heart) (Free your mind)
Stop! In the name of love (In the name)
Before you break my heart (Of love)

[PUCK with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS, (FINN), {ARTIE}]
Free your mind and the rest will follow (Stop! In the name of love) (Artie: Oh free your mind)
Be color blind, don't be so shallow (Before you break my heart) {You got to be!}
Free your mind and the rest will follow (Stop! In the name of love) {Wo, oh oh!}
Be color blind, don't be so shallow (Before you break my heart) {Don't break my, don't break my heart}

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS, (ARTIE), {PUCK}]
Stop! In the name of love, (You got to stop it, you got to stop)
Before you break my heart (Don't break my heart) {Free your mind}
Stop! In the name of love, (Stop! Stop!) before you break my heart

Oh think it over

[PUCK & NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS]
Free your mind

[ARTIE & FINN NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS]
And the rest will stop!
