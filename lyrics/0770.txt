[Intro]
Underneath the city lights
There is a world few know about
Where rules don't apply, no
And you can't keep a good girl down

[Verse 1]
She comes through the club looking for a good time
Gonna make that, shake that, money on a dime
Don't need a suga daddy, she can work it just fine
Up on the table, she'll be dancing all night

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, Babydoll, just come to life
Under the spotlight
All the girls wanna fall in line

[Pre-Chorus]
We say
He-eh-eh-hey
Here come the ladies 'bout to give a little show
He-eh-eh-hey
Here go the boys, you gotta show a little more, more, more, more

[Chorus]
Hit it up, get it up (Won't let you rest)
Hit it up, get it up (This is not a test)
Hit it up, get it up (Gotta give me your best)
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
Hit it up, get it up (Won't let you rest)
Hit it up, get it up (This is not a test)
Hit it up, get it up (Gotta give me your best)
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque

[Verse 3]
A little bit of naughty, it's a little bit nice
She's a whole lot of glam, sweat, sugar, sex, spice
Shimmy, shimmy, strut, strut, give a little what, what
Up on the tables, we'll be dancing all night

[Verse 4]
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, everybody just comes to life
Under the spotlight
All the boys wanna fall behind

[Pre-Chorus]
We say
He-eh-eh-hey
Here come the ladies 'bout to give a little show
He-eh-eh-hey
Here go the boys, you gotta show a little more

[Chorus]
Hit it up, get it up (Won't let you rest)
Hit it up, get it up (This is not a test)
Hit it up, get it up (Gotta give me your best)
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
Hit it up, get it up (Won't let you rest)
Hit it up, get it up (This is not a test)
Hit it up, get it up (Gotta give me your best)
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque

[Interlude]
Okay girls, let's show them how it's done
It ain't over 'til we say
And weâ€™ve only just begun

[Bridge]
Lemme hear you say
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Say yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah
Say yeah-eah-eah-eah, yeah!
Say yeah, yeah, yeah-eah yeah

[Chorus]
Hit it up, get it up (Won't let you rest)
Hit it up, get it up (This is not a test)
Hit it up, get it up (Gotta give me your best)
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
Hit it up, get it up (Won't let you rest)
Hit it up, get it up (This is not a test)
Hit it up, get it up (Gotta give me your best)
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
