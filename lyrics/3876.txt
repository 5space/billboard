[Verse]
If I could hock my love, could I trade
For your wings to cover me, unless I fall?
Half aligned, I heard the most brilliant lie
To sleep these eyes, closed the light
And lets the mind wide open

[Pre-Hook]
You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue, you save face
Or feeding on the blood that's running from a black day

[Hook]
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain

[Verse]
If I could hock my love, could I trade
For your wings to cover me, unless I fall?
To sleep these eyes, closed the light
And gets the mind wide open

[Pre-Hook]
You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue to save face
Or feeding on the blood that's running from a black day

[Hook - Variation]
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
Cry on, cry on black rain
Black rain (cry on)
Black rain (cry on)
(Cry on)

[Pre-Hook]
You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue, you save face
Or feeding on the blood that's running from a black day
