[Intro: Priscilla Renea]
Psychotic, Barney Mika rap

[Verse 1: Both]
La la, la la
You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular bitch
Standing on the field with your pretty pompons
Now you're working at the movie selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
'Cause I'm putting down my stories in a popular song (La la)
( Uh ooh)
Said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar
You were always popular
You were singing, all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row
'Cause my song is popular

[Chorus: Both]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

[Post-Chorus: Both]
Catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
Catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go


[Verse 2: MIKA & Priscilla Renea]
I was on the lookout for someone to hate
Picking on me like a dinner plate
I hid during classes, and in between them
Dunk me in the toilet now its you that cleans 'em
You tryin' to make me feel bad with the shit you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh the joke's on you
And everyone's laughing, got everyone clapping, asking
How come you look so cool?
'Cause that's the only thing that I learned at school ha what
Uh-huh Said that's the only thing I've learned at school

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar
You were always popular
You were singing, all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row
'Cause my song is popular

[Chorus: Both]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

[Post-Chorus: Both]
Catch up, 'cause you got an awful long way to go
Catch up, 'cause you got an awful long way to go

[Bridge: Both]
Before the next time that you call him crazy
Lazy, a faggot, or that fugazi
Here's the one thing that's so amazing
It ain't a bad thing to be a loser, baby!
All you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
All you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were (All you ever need to know)

[Outro: Both]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
All you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
All you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were (That's all you ever need to know)
All you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
All you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were (That's all you ever need to know)
All you ever need to know
