[Intro]
Come on!

[Verse 1]
She's no good for me, I know that she's, a wildflower
She's got a restlessness, a beautifulness, a thing about her
But here I am again, callin' her back
Lettin' her drive me crazy

[Chorus]
It's like I love this pain, a little too much
Love my heart all busted up
Somethin' about her, we just don't work
But I can't walk away
It's like I love this pain

[Verse 2]
It's just an on again, and off again, situation
It's just strikin' a match, a tank of gas, combination
But here I am again, lightin' it up
Knowin' that she'll just burn me

[Chorus]
It's like I love this pain, a little too much
Love my heart all busted up
Somethin' about her, we just don't work
But I can't walk away
It's like I love this pain

[Bridge]
It's like I love this life
When nothing's right, yeah, something's wrong
It's like I'm just not me
If I can't be a sad, sad song

[Chorus]
It's like I love this pain a little too much
Love my heart all busted up
Somethin' about her, we just don't work
But I can't walk away
It's like I love this pain

[Outro]
It's like I love this pain
I can't walk away
Oh no
It's like I love this pain
