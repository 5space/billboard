[Verse 1: Brantley Gilbert]
I can't go for a ride to clear my head
'Cause everything I pass puts you back in it
Yeah, we're done, movin' on
But you can't be too far gone

[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert & Lindsay Eli]
'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town
Every back road we've ever gone down
Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews
Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you
Every whisper, every room I walk in
Every time the bartender fills it up again
Everybody knows why I'm here, and you ain't around
'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town

[Verse 2: Lindsay Eli, Lindsay Eli & Brantley Gilbert]
Oh, we said this goodbye was the last
I guess I could leave, I could run from the past
And from us, and from you
But this is where I belong, this is my home too

[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert & Lindsay Eli]
What happens in a small town stays in a small town
Every back road we've ever gone down
Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews
Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you
Every whisper, every room I walk in
Every time the bartender fills it up again
Everybody knows why I'm here, and you ain't around
'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town

[Bridge: Brantley Gilbert, Lindsay Eli, Both]
Yeah, I'm still here, yeah
And every time I see that little white Jeep
Yeah, that hand-me-down Ford pullin' down your street
You wonder if somebody's in my seat
If you're movin' on or you're stuck like me
What happens in a small town
Stays in a small town, oh yeah

[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert & Lindsay Eli]
What happens in a small town stays in a small town
Every back road we've ever gone down
Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews
Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you
Every whisper, every room I walk in
Every time the bartender fills it up again
Everybody knows why I'm here, and you ain't around
(You ain't around)
'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town

[Outro: Brantley Gilbert & Lindsay Eli]
It stays in a small town
It stays in a small town
And I'm still here
(What happens in a small town)
I'm still here
(Stays in a small town)
I'm still here
Yeah, I'm still here
I'm still here
