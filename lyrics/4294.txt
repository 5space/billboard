[Intro]
Uh, huh

[Chorus]
You niggas gon' end up in a hearse, hearse
You niggas gon' end up in the dirt, dirt
From the trenches, had to make it work, work
And these fuck niggas just gon' make it worse, worse
Arm (Arm), arm
Ho, that's in enemy arms (Arms)
Ho, that's in enemy arms (Arms)
Tear down an enemy's army (Army)
Tear down an enemy's army (Army)
Ho, that's in enemy's arms (Arms)
Ho, that's in enemy's arms (Arms)

[Verse 1]
I wish the enemy harm (Harm)
Huh, bitch, I'm a star (Star)
Foreign lil' whip and I'm whippin' this car (Car)
I might just park in the yard (Yard)
Catch the opps lackin', I rip 'em apart (Yeah)
Fuck it, I got no heart
Show no emotions, I live in the dark (Dark)
I don't know why but that bitch left me scarred (Scarred)
I don't know why you just ain't play your part (Part)
Now you focused on wishing me harm (Harm)
Fuck it, right to bear arms (Arms)
I keep that stick on me, armed (Armed)

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the enemy arms
I cannot fold under enemy arms (Arms)
Under the enemy arms (Arms)
Under the enemy arms

[Chorus]
You niggas gon' end up in a hearse, hearse
You niggas gon' end up in the dirt, dirt
From the trenches had to make it work, work
And these fuck niggas just gon' make it worse, worse

[Verse 2]
War
I'm in this bitch with the gang
I'm in this bitch with the gang, ayy
I'm in this bitch with the gang
Thirty, we gon' let it bang, ayy
Chopper, we gon' let it bang
Blowin' your brain, it's sad
Chopper, we gon' let it bang
Blowin' your brain, it's sad
War
I'm in this bitch with the gang
I'm in this bitch with the gang, ayy
I'm in this bitch with the gang
Thirty, we gon' let it bang, ayy
Chopper, we gon' let it bang
Blowin' your brain, it's sad
Chopper, we gon' let it bang
Blowin' your brain, it's sad

[Chorus]
You niggas gon' end up in a hearse, hearse
You niggas gon' end up in the dirt, dirt
From the trenches had to make it work, work
And these fuck niggas just gon' make it worse, worse
Arm (Arm), arm
Ho, that's in enemy arms (Arms)
Ho, that's in enemy arms (Arms)
Tear down an enemy's army (Army)
Tear down an enemy's army (Army)
Ho, that's in enemy's arms (Arms)
Ho, that's in enemy's arms (Arms)
