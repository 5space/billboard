[PUCK]
One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel alright

[ARTIE, PUCK, ARTIE with PUCK]
Hear the children cryin' (One love)
Hear the children cryin' (One heart)
Sayin' give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Sayin' let's get together and feel alright
Wo wo-wo wo-wo

[ARTIE, PUCK]
Let them all pass all their dirty remarks
There is one question I'd really love to ask
One heart
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?

[ARTIE, PUCK, ARTIE with PUCK]
Believe me
One love (What about the one heart?)
One heart (What about love)
Let's get together and feel alright
As it was in the beginnin' (One love)
So shall it be in the end, alright (One heart)
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright

[PUCK, ARTIE]
One more thing
Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon (One love)
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom (One song)
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation

[ARTIE & PUCK]
Sayin'...
One love (What about the one heart?)
One heart (What about the...)
Let's get together and feel all right
I'm pleadin' to mankind (One love)
What about the one heart? (One heart)
(Ohhh) Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
(Yeah) Let's get together and feel alright
