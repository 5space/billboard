[Verse 1]
Everybody's always waiting on Friday
Watching that clock and sitting on go
Whatcha' say we find a little warm sunshine
An open umbrella on the patio
I don't need a reason or a happy hour
Ain't hangin' 'round for a fireworks show
Get a head start, a little sip of somethin'
Off and running, here we go
One, two, three, here we go

[Chorus]
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?

[Verse 2]
Blame it on the work day
Blame it on the heatwave
Blame it on the tick-tock movin' too slow
Blame it on any old thing you want to
Ready, get set, baby, here we go

[Chorus]
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?

[Bridge]
Day drinking, d-d-d-day drinking
Day drinking, d-d-d-day drinking

[Chorus]
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling all right
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
