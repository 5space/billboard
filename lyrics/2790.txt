[Verse 1]
Thought you'd change the weather
Start a little storm
Make a little rain
But I'm going to do one better hide the sun until you pray
I'm a tornado, looking for a soul to take

[Verse 2]
You're going to see me coming by the selfish things that you did
I'm going to leave you guessing how this funnel is going to hit
I'm a tornado, looking for a man to break

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found

[Verse 3]
Thought you'd take a swing
Try another girl, try another night
But it's the pain that brings my force of nature back to life
I'm a tornado more disturbed than an F5

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
OOOOOOOOOOO
MMMMMMMMMM

[Chorus]
I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found

[Verse 4]
The winds are getting stronger
And the sky is falling through
And you ain't got much longer
Til the rage rips off the roof
I'm a tornado... and I'm coming after you...

[Bridge]
Oooo...
Hmm...
Oooo...

[Outro]
(I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground)
