[BLAINE & (THE WARBLERS)]
Oh yeah (Pa-pa) (Oooh) (Pa-pa)
(Oooooh) Oh yeah (Pa-pa) (Ooooh) (Oooh, ahh)
So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
Now I wrote two hundred letters
I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much
Deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them be

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS, (BLAINE)]
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[BLAINE & (THE WARBLERS), ((WITH WARBLERS))]
Your salty skin and how it
Mixes in with mine (Mixes in with mine)
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined (Completely intertwined)
It's not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know (That I didn't know)
It's not what I didn't feel
It's ((What I didn't show))

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS, (BLAINE)]
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back (Yeah)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS harmonizing]
You say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun

[THE WARBLERS]
(Waiting for the sun)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS harmonizing]
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting there
I don't care where I have to go

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me

[BLAINE]
(Oh yeah)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad

[BLAINE]
(Oh)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
You really got me bad

[BLAINE]
(Oh yeah)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad

[BLAINE]
(Got me bad)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
You really got me bad

[BLAINE]
(Got me bad)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
