[Verse 1]
Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want 'em too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lies, your lies
Every time you close your eyes

[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

[Verse 2]
You told me not to worry 'bout
Those guys, those guys
You told me that you left it all behind
Behind

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lies, your lies
Every time you close your eyes

[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

[Bridge]
Wipe the
Lust from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes
You can't hide it
You can't be the one
I realize, we're divided

[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
