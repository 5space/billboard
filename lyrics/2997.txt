[Verse 1: Khalid]
Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
I'll comfort you for sure

If we're caught in a wave
I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are
I'll run to your front door

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm 100 with you

[Chorus: Khalid]
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

[Post-Chorus: Khalid]
Loves, between our love
Loves, between our love

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Shadows play on idle hands
I lose myself I do
But I'll find my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you

If we're caught in a wave
I will carry you over
It don't matter where we are
You're still the one I choose

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm 100 with you

[Chorus: Khalid]
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave (in a wave)
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

[Bridge: Khalid]
Loves, between our love
Loves, between our love

[Chorus: Khalid]
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
