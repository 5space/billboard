I've got a number on a napkin, a pounding in my head
It takes everything I've got to crawl out of bed
I lost a hell of a woman, freedom caught me on the chin
But I'm doing alright for the shape I'm in
The sun came up again this morning
I got a call from a long lost friend
Planned us a little road trip down in New Orleans
It ain't much, but it beats where I've been
Yeah, I'm doing alright, I'm doing alright
I'm doing alright for the shape I'm in, yeah
Well, I'm getting better at barely getting by
When I look at her picture, I don't break down and cry
And all this time on my hands, it's getting easier to spend
'Cause I'm doing alright for the shape I'm in
The sun came up again this morning
And I took my old past back for a spin
Now when it rains, it ain't always pouring
And I'm learning how to live again
Yeah, I'm doing alright, I'm doing alright
I'm doing alright for the shape I'm in
Yeah, I'm doing alright, yes, I'm doing alright
Yeah, I'm doing alright for the shape I'm in
Yes, I'm doing alright, yeah, I'm doing alright
Yeah, I'm doing alright for the shape I'm in
