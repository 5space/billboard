[Verse 1]
People always say I have a laugh
Like my mother does
Guess that makes sense
She taught me how to smile
When things get rough
I've got her spirit, and she's always got my back
When I look at her, I think I wanna be just like that

[Chorus]
When I love
I give it all I've got
Like my mother does
When I'm scared
I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I feel weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because I see myself
Like my mother does

[Verse 2]
I never met a stranger
I can talk to anyone
Like my mother does
I let my temper fly
And she can walk away
When she's had enough
She sees everybody for who they really are
I'm so thankful for her guidance
She helped me get this far

[Chorus]
When I love
I give it all I've got
Like my mother does
When I'm scared
I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I feel weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because I see myself
Like my mother does

[Bridge]
She's a rock, she is grace
She's an angel
She's my heart and soul
She does it all

[Chorus]
When I love
I give it all I've got
Like my mother does
And when I'm scared
I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I'm weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because I see myself
Like my mother does
Like my mother does

[Outro]
I hear people sayin'
I'm starting to look like my mother does
