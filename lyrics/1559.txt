[Intro: Rachel]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus 1: Finn & Rachel with New Directions]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1: Finn, Kurt, Mercedes]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

[Chorus 1: Finn & Rachel with New Directions]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1: Finn, Rachel, Jesse, Mercedes]
I'm like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control, just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing
Ooh

[Chorus 1: Finn & Rachel with New Directions & The Choir]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Reprise: New Directions & The Choir]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Life is a mystery (Oh, oh)
Everyone must stand alone (Oh, oh)
I hear you call my name (Oh, oh)
And it feels like home

[Chorus 2: Finn & Rachel with New Directions (& The Choir), Mercedes]
Just like a prayer (Oh)
Your voice can take me there (Oh)
Just like a muse to me (Oh)
You are a mystery (Oh)
Just like a dream (Oh)
You are not what you seem (Oh)
Just like a prayer
No choice, your voice can take me there

[Bridge: New Directions & The Choir, (Mercedes)]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there!)
It's like a dream to me (Oh)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there!)
It's like a dream to me (Just like a dream to me, like a prayer)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh)
It's like a dream to me (Like a dream, like a dream)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there!)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, yeah!)

[Reprise: Rachel with New Directions, (The Choir), Mercedes]
Life is a mystery (Just like a prayer)
Everyone must stand alone (Your voice can take me there)(Ooh)
I hear you call my name (I hear it call)
And it feels like home

[Chorus 2: Rachel with New Directions, (The Choir), MERCEDES]
Just like a prayer (Just like) (Ooh)
Your voice can take me there (A prayer) (Ooh)
Just like a muse to me (Your voice can take me there)
You are a mystery (Take you there, take you there)
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer (Oh, woah)
No choice, your voice can take me there (Yeah)
Just like a prayer (Yeah, yeah)
Your voice can take me there (Ooh)

[Outro: Rachel, (THE CHOIR), New Directions, Mercedes]
Just like a dream (Just like)
You are not what you seem (A prayer)
Just like a prayer
No choice, your voice can take me there (Yeah)
