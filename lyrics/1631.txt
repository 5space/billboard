[BLAINE (and COOPER)]
Dark in the city, night is a wire
Steam in the subway, earth is afire
(Do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do)

[COOPER]
Woman, you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind

[BLAINE & (COOPER)]
Do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand (Smell like I sound!)
Just like that river, twisting through a dusty land (Straddle the line!)
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can (Mouth is alive!)
Oh, Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande

[BLAINE & (COOPER)]
Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
(Do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do)

[COOPER]
High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind

[BLAINE & COOPER]
Do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do

[BLAINE & COOPER with NEW DIRECTIONS (COOPER with NEW DIRECTIONS)]
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand (Smell like I sound!)
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land (Straddle the line!)
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can (Mouth is alive!)
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

[BLAINE]
Hungry like the wolf
I'm hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Don't make a sound!

[COOPER with NEW DIRECTIONS (BLAINE & COOPER with NEW DIRECTIONS), {BLAINE}, |Cooper|, NEW DIRECTIONS]
Her name is Rio; she don't need to understand {Yeah!}
Smell like I sound!
(And I might find her if I'm looking like I can)
Straddle the line!
(Oh, Rio, Rio, hear them shout across the land)
Mouth is alive!
(From mountains in the north, down to the Rio Grande)
Burning the ground!
(Her name is Rio; she don't need to understand) |Oh!|
(Smell like I sound!)
(From mountains in the north, down to the Rio Grande)
Burnin' the ground
