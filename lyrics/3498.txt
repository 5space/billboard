[Intro: PnB Rock]
Ah
Oh-oh
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock & XXXTENTACION]
Mama had five boys, me, I was the middle child
By the age of 13, bitch, I was young and wild
Caught my first case, then I got kicked out my mama house
Got nowhere to stay, bitch, I'm runnin' in your fuckin' house (Bitch)
With them 30s out (Yeah), fuck you talkin' 'bout? (Yeah)
Yeah, ridin' 'round 'round the city, I swear I'm lurking out (Lurking out)
Really I'm high as  shit, I'm off a Perky now (Perky now)
Huh, nigga run up on me, I'ma blow eem down

[Post-Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
So much cash in my jeans, Louis V, pocket wallet
Niggas hate, niggas bitches, niggas bitches, pocket watchin'
Uh, not talkin' 'bout no pistol, talkin' 30s now (30s now)
Hey, hey, 30s now, 30 bands, 30 now (Hey)

[Verse: PnB Rock & XXXTENTACION]
Pussy nigga always talkin', why the fuck these niggas talkin'?
I don't know, pull up slow, sticks out the window, look what you started
Huh, yeah, catch a opp outta bounds and we gon' burn eem down (Burn eem down)
Burn eem down, 30 rounds, hunnid rounds (Buck, buck, buck)
Hold up, niggas don't want no smoke
Roll up, dead niggas when I smoke
Bad bitch, she put it all in her throat
She suck my dick while I float in the Ghost
New bustdown, yeah, my wrist is on froze (Ice)
These niggas is hoes, I keep me a pole
I swear these new bitches be doing the most
Slimin' like I'm drippin' snot from my nose (Slatt)
You know I came from the mud with this (Mud)
They never showed me no love with this (Yeah)
I had to jugg and finesse, used to stand on the corner
Was selling them drugs and shit (Drugs)
They used to be on some other shit (Uh)
Now they see me coming up and shit (Uh)
I tell them leeches to suck a dick (Uh)
Nowadays they see me dubbin' shit

[Chorus: PnB Rock & XXXTENTACION]
Mama had five boys, me, I was the middle child
By the age of 13, bitch, I was young and wild
Caught my first case, then I got kicked out my mama house
Got nowhere to stay, bitch, I'm runnin' in your fuckin' house (Bitch)
With them 30s out (Yeah), fuck you talkin' 'bout? (Yeah)
Yeah, ridin' 'round 'round the city, I swear I'm lurking out (Lurking out)
Really I'm high as  shit, I'm off a Perky now (Perky now)
