[Intro]
Uh-huh (Uh-huh, ooh)
Uh-huh (Alright, alright)
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
I've been grinding so long, been trying this shit for years (Uh-huh)
And I got nothing to show, just climbing this rope right here
(Right here, uh-huh)
And if there's a man upstairs, he kept bringing me rain (Uh-huh)
But I've been sending up prayers and something's changed (Changed)

[Pre-Chorus]
I think I finally found my hallelujah
I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Now all my dreams are coming true, yeah
I've been waiting for this moment

[Chorus]
Feels good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Hallelujah, let that bass line move ya, say hey
And it's good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)

[Verse 2]
I was dead in the water, nobody wanted me (Uh-huh)
I was old news, I went cold as cold could be (Uh-huh)
But I kept throwing on coal tryna make that fire burn (Uh-huh)
Sometimes you gotta get scars to get what you deserve (Uh-huh)
I kept moving on and now I'm moving up (Uh-huh)
Damn, I'm feeling blessed with all this love (Love)

[Pre-Chorus]
I think I finally found my hallelujah
I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Now all my dreams are coming true, yeah
I've been waiting for this moment

[Chorus]
Feels good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Hallelujah, let that bass line move ya, say hey
And it's good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)

[Bridge]
I almost can-, cannot handle it (Hey)
I could get u-, could get used to this (Hey)
I almost can-, cannot handle it (Hey)
I could get u-, could get used to this

[Pre-Chorus]
I think I finally found my
(Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah)

[Chorus]
Feels good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Hallelujah, let that bass line move ya, say hey
And it's good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)

[Outro]
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (Woo-hoo)
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (Uh-huh)
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (Alright)
