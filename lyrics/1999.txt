[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Undefeated

[Verse 1]
Wish I knew then what I know now, but, I, I
Can’t change the past no matter how I try, I
So I’ma get up and dance, you know
Cause this might be my last chance (whoa)
Like there’s nobody around
Even gravity can’t keep me down

[Chorus]
Everybody get it started
I’m on top of the world, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated (yeah)
No one told me what I could be
Now I’m walking on air, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated, tonight
Undefeated

[Verse 2]
No looking back can’t live that way, right now, ow
Yesterday’s gone, I’ve found my way somehow, ow
So I’ma get up and dance, you know
Cause this might be my last chance (whoa)
Like there’s nobody around
Even gravity can’t keep me down

[Chorus]
Everybody get it started
I’m on top of the world, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated (yeah)
No one told me what I could be
Now I’m walking on air, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated, tonight

[Bridge]
So I’ll live today like it’s my last one
There’s no time for fear, you only live once

[Chorus]
Everybody get it started
I’m on top of the world, what a feeling
Everybody say
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Please believe it, I’m undefeated
No one told me what I could be
Now I’m walking on air, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated, tonight

[Outro]
What a feeling (yeah)
To be undefeated
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Undefeated, tonight
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Undefeated
