[THE TROUBLETONES]
Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh

[MERCEDES]
She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you, and boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore

[THE TROUBLETONES]
Rumour has it, oooh-ooh
Rumour has it, oooh-ooh
Rumour has it, oooh-ooh
Rumour has it, oooh-ooh

[SANTANA]
Don't forget me, I beg (Rumour has it, rumour has it)
I remember you said (Rumour has it, rumour has it, rumour has it)

I heard that you settled down (Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh)
That you've found a girl and you're married now (Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh)
I heard that your dreams came true (Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh)
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you (Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh)

[MERCEDES]
Woah, rumour has it (Rumour has it, rumour has it)
Yeah, baby (Rumour has it, rumour has it)

[SANTANA]
(Rumour has it) Don't forget me
(Rumour has it) I beg
(Rumour has it) I remember you said
(Rumour has it, rumour has it)

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me, and boy, you're bringin' me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

[MERCEDES]
(Rumour has it, rumour has it) Yeah...
(Rumour has it, rumour has it) Yeah...

[SANTANA]
(Rumour has it) Don't forget me
(Rumour has it) I beg
(Rumour has it) I remember you said
(Rumour has it)

[MERCEDES]
(Rumour has it, rumour has it) Hey heeeey, yeah
(Rumour has it, rumour has it) Rumour has it

[SANTANA]
(Rumour has it) Don't forget me
(Rumour has it) I beg
(Rumour has it) I remember you said
(Rumour has it)

[THE TROUBLETONES]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you (Rumour has it)
I wish nothing but the best for you, too (Rumour has it)

[SANTANA]
Don't forget me, I beg (Rumour has it, rumour has it)
I remember you said (Rumour has it)

[MERCEDES]
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
