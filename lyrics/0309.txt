[Verse 1: Bella Thorne & Zendaya]
I don't need no one to tell me how to feel the beat
And I don't need no beat to tell me how to move my feet
Just go and do what you do
'Cause there's nothin' to prove
I'm just bein' me, w-watch me do me
I don't need no magazine to tell me who to be
And I don't need to pose for pa-pa-paparazzi
Just keep the cameras flashin' to try to catch this action
I'm just bein' me w-watch me do me
Me, me, me

[Chorus: Zendaya & Bella Thorne]
Light up the floor, play me one more
Let me hear that
Click clack on the hi-hat, let the bass vibrate
(Feel the room rock)
Light up the floor, just like before
Let me hear that
Bass drop on the boombox, make your heart stop
Feel the room rock
I'm doin' all I want to do
And I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just bein' me, watch me do me
Me, me
(Watch me do me)
Me, me
(Watch me, watch)

[Verse 2: Bella Thorne & Zendaya]
I don't need no music when I wanna sing a song (w-watch me)
I don't need what's popular to know what's right or wrong (w-watch me)
I'm busy burning the track, not holdin' anything back
I'm just bein' me, w-watch me do me
Me, me, me

[Chorus: Zendaya & Bella Thorne]
Light up the floor, play me one more
Let me hear that
Click clack on the hi-hat, let the bass vibrate
(Feel the room rock)
Light up the floor, just like before
Let me hear that
Bass drop on the boombox, make your heart stop
Feel the room rock
I'm doin' all I want to do
And I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just bein' me, watch me do me

[Bridge: Zendaya & Bella Thorne]
I'm ready, I'm, I'm ready to go (let's go)
Le-let it, let, le-let it explode (oh, yeah)
I'm ready, I'm, I'm ready to go, to go, to go
(Go, go, go, go)

[Chorus: Zendaya & Bella Thorne]
Light up the floor, play me one more
Let me hear that
Click clack on the hi-hat, let the bass vibrate
(Feel the room rock)
Light up the floor, just like before
Let me hear that
Bass drop on the boombox, make your heart stop
I'm doin' all I want to do
And I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just bein' me, watch me do me

[Outro: Bella Thorne]
Me, me
Watch me do me
Me, me
Watch me, watch me
