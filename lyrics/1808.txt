[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy, are you afraid of the dark, dark?
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me, do you know where to start, start?
And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel a part, part
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound, sound
Well, the sound is the key to my heart, heart

[Chorus]
We run, yes, we run the night, the night
We run, yes, we run the night, night, night, night, night
We run, yes, we run the night
(We, we, we run, we, we, we run)
We run, yes, we run the night, the night, night, night, night, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!

[Verse 2]
Feeling like a rush, rush, rush
Pushing passed me, all over my skin, skin
I can't get enough 'nough 'nough 'nough
'Cause the beat keeps pulling me in
Taking me so high up, up, up
A place that I've never been, ahhhh
Party, party all night, night, night
Sleep all day, then do it again, 'gain

[Chorus]
We run, yes, we run the night, the night
We run, yes, we run the night, night, night, night, night
We run, yes, we run the night
(We, we, we run, we, we, we run)
We run, yes we run the night, the night, night, night, night, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!

[Bridge]
Eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh
Turn the lights down
Turn the lights down
Eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh
Turn the lights down, down
Turn the lights down

[Chorus]
We run, yes, we run the night, the night (We run, we run)
We run, yes, we run the night, night, night, night, night
We run, yes, we run the night
(We, we, we run, we, we, we run)
We run, yes, we run the night, the night, night, night, night
