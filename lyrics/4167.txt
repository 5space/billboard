[Verse 1: Keifer Thompson]
A car's got gasoline to run, down the road
A crop's got rain, dirt and sun, to make 'em grow
A song's got rhyme
A clock's got time
You got me and

[Chorus: Both]
Baby I got you
Yeah you're it
The missing piece that makes me fit
I got you, the breath I breathe
And there ain't nothing else I need
Baby I got you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Shawna]
I don't need a big ol' house, full of stuff
What my arms are wrapped around, that's enough
Your morning smile, your kiss goodnight
[Both]
And everything's alright

[Chorus: Both]
'Cause I got you
Yeah you're it
The missing piece that makes me fit
I got you, the breath I breathe
And there ain't nothing else I need
Baby I got you

[Bridge]
[Keifer:]
When the right goes wrong
[Both:]
When I'm scared to death and got nothing left to lean on

[Verse 3]
[Both]
I got you
[Shawna]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah I do
[Keifer]
Baby I got you
[Both]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
[Keifer]
Yeah you got me too

[Chorus: Both]
I got you
Yeah you're it
The missing piece that makes me fit
I got you, the breath I breathe
And there ain't nothing else I need
Baby I got you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Tag]
[Shawna:]
Yeah baby
[Keifer:]

[Both:]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
[Keifer:]
Baby I got you
Baby I got you
