[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
In my truck flying down a dirt road
Pickin' you up, feelin' kinda crazy
I think I'm in luck cause I know my baby
She slaps my knee says: "boy why you smiling?"
Doing my best so hard to hide it
I know what's up, so I just shoot her a wink

[Chorus]
Cause when the sun goes down it'll get a little hotter
Make an old boy's heart beat a little harder
I know I can't lose cause it's going down smooth tonight, baby
One ain't enough man may I have another Sitting 'round the fire gettin' drunk on each other
Every day I pray I thank God I got her She's the moon in my shine, the whiskey in my water

[Verse 2]
When we're past Flint Bridge, we'll break out the bottle
Drop it down low, crank up the throttle
I'm good to go, cause I've got you tonight, baby

[Chorus]
Cause when the sun goes down it'll get a little hotter
Make an old boy's heart beat a little harder
I know I can't lose cause it's going down smooth tonight, baby
One ain't enough man may I have another Sitting 'round the fire gettin' drunk on each other
Every day I pray I thank God I got her She's the moon in my shine, the whiskey in my water

[Bridge]
Sitting on this hill with her
Looking in them baby blues
Wishing that the sky would change
I've been thinking about it all damn day
I can hardly wait

[Chorus]
Cause when the sun goes down it'll get a little hotter
Make an old boy's heart beat a little harder
I know I can't lose cause it's going down smooth tonight baby
One ain't enough man may I have another Sitting 'round the fire gettin' drunk on each other
Every day I pray I thank God I got her She's the moon in my shine, the whiskey in my water

[Hook]
Whiskey in my water
Whiskey in my water yeah yeah yeah
