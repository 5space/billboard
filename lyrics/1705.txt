[SANTANA]
At first I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live
Without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

[MERCEDES]
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should've changed that stupid lock
I should've made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

[SANTANA]
Oh, now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one
Who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble?
You think I'd lay down and die?

[BRITTANY with THE TROUBLETONES (SUGAR)]
I'm a survivor (What!)
I'm not gon' give up (What!)
I'm not gon' stop (What!)
I'm gon' work harder (What!)
I'm a survivor (What!)
I'm gonna make it (What!)
I will survive (What!)
Keep on survivin' (What!)

[MERCEDES]
It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart

[SANTANA]
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high

[BRITTANY with THE TROUBLETONES (SUGAR)]
I'm a survivor (What!)
I'm not gon' give up (What!)
I'm not gon' stop (What!)
I'm gon' work harder (What!)
I'm a survivor (What!)
I'm gonna make it (What!)
I will survive (What!)
Keep on survivin' (What!)

[MERCEDES & (THE TROUBLETONES)]
Yeahhhh!
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah-eah!

Thought I couldn't (Aaah) breathe without you
I'm (Aaah) inhalin'
You thought I couldn't (Aaah) see without you
Perfect (Aaah) vision
You thought I couldn't (Aaah) last without you
But I'm (Aaah) lastin'
You thought that I would (Aaah) die without you
But I'm (Aaah) livin'

[SANTANA & (THE TROUBLETONES)]
Thought that I would (Aaah) fail without you
But I'm (Aaah) on top
Thought it would be (Aaah) over by now
But it (Aaah) won't stop
Thought that I would (Aaah) self-destruct
But I'm (Aaah) still here
Even in my (Aaah) years to come
I'm still gon' be here!
