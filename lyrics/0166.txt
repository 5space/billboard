[Verse 1]
Hey shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal: eeny, meeny, miny, moe
And flower, you're the chosen one

[Chorus 1]
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no

[Verse 2]
I tackle, we tussle
And oh my days, we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his
Colt single-action army
Oh, no

[Chorus 1]
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no

[Verse 3]
N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz, girl, you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
Oh my days, he disagrees
Oh, no
(Speak easy)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 2]
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Hey shady, baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal: eeny, meeny, miny, moe
And flower, you're the chosen one

[Chorus 2]
Well, your left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free
Oh, no
