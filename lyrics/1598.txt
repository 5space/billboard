[SANTANA]
Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
Always someone marches brave
Here beneath my skin
And constant craving (Constant craving)
Has always been (Always been)

[SHELBY]
Maybe a great magnet pulls
All souls towards truth
Or maybe it is life itself
Feeds wisdom to its youth

[SANTANA & SHELBY with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Constant craving (Constant craving)
Has always been (Always been)

[SANTANA & SHELBY]
Craving
Ah-ha
Constant craving
Has always been
Has always been

[SANTANA & SHELBY with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Constant craving (Constant craving)
Has always been (Always been)

[KURT, SANTANA, & (SHELBY)]
Has always been (Always been)

[KURT, (SANTANA & SHELBY)]
Has always been (Always been)

[KURT & SANTANA, (SHELBY)]
Has always been (Has always been)

[KURT, SANTANA, & SHELBY]
Has always been
Has always been
