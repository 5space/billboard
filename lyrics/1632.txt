[FINN (with NEW DIRECTIONS)]
What I want you've got
It might be hard to handle
Like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame (Eh Eh)
What I've got's full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
You pull them all together
And how I can't explain
Oh yeah!

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing (QUINN with NEW DIRECTIONS)]
Well well you... (I can't go for that)
You make my dreams come true (I can't go for that, I can't go for that)
Well well well you (I can't go for that)
Oh yeah, you make (My dreams come) true

[NEW DIRECTIONS & (RORY)]
I can't go for that (Yeah, yeah)
I can't go for that

[RORY & TINA]
On a night, when
Bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer

[FINN & TINA]
I can laugh it in your face

[RORY with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Twist and shout my way out

[RORY & TINA]
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me

[FINN & TINA]
And I'll never be the same
Oh yeah
Well 'cause you

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing (QUINN with NEW DIRECTIONS), {RORY}]
(I can't go for that)
You make (My dreams come) true
(I can't go for that, I can't go for that)
Well well {oh woah I} well you (I can't go for that)
Oh yeah, you make (My dreams) come true

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
I can't go for that

I'm down on my daydream
But that sleepwalk should be over by now
I know!
