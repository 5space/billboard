[Verse 1: Harry & Liam]
There's a lightning in your eyes, I can't deny
Then there's me inside a sinking boat
Running out of time
Without you, I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes I know, we'll be alright
There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me
And every time I turn around, it's only gaining speedThere's a moment when you finally realize
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes I know that I'll be fine

[Chorus: All & Harry]
This time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run

[Verse 2: Niall & Louis]
There's a future in my life I can't foresee
Unless of course I stay on course and keep you next to me
There will always be the kind that criticize
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright

[Chorus: All]
This time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run

[Bridge: Zayn & All]
This time I'm ready to run (Ready to run)
I'd give everything that I've got for your love

[Chorus: Harry & All]
This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run
