[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Prince Royce
Big Snoop Dogg (What?)
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
(¿Qué lo que, mami?)

[Verse 1: Prince Royce]
I like you talking dirty, I like your filthy love
You like the way I hold you when we are falling in love
(Yo sé que si) In love
(Mami, yo sé que si) If it's love
Then I don't want to come back up
Girl I know you're a handful 'cause you know what you like
You might be hard to handle but I'ma show you tonight
(Pero que rica estás) Tonight
(Que rica estás) What it's like
(What it's like) When you're

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
Stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up
Gotta work me out, make it real
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up
Gotta work me out, make it real
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling

[Post-Chorus: Prince Royce]
(Dímelo, mami)
Stuck on a feeling
Check it out

[Verse 2: Prince Royce]
Let's go hide out in private
Won't you show me your place? (Your place)
A little peace and quiet (Woo)
Where we can both misbehave (Misbehave)
Misbehave (Misbehave)
It's okay (It's okay) when you're

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
Stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up
Gotta work me out, make it real
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up
Gotta work me out, make it real
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling

[Post-Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Prince Royce]
What, what, what, what, what?
(Ven conmigo mami)
Stuck on a feeling

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a, she got me, she got, she got

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Wheelin' and dealin, appealin, I'm realin'
Ya still in love with me, all green
I'm at it, romantic, no panic, organic
Slide right next to me, in ecstasy
Now who could ever make you feel like I felt
You're laying on your bed, just playing with yourself
You're moaning and groaning, you're squirming and squealing
Guess it's true, I left you

[Chorus: Prince Royce & Snoop Dogg]
Stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up (Yeah-eh)
Gotta work me out, make it real (Work it out, yeah)
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough (Stuck on a feeling)
Better lock this down, better box it up (Stuck on a feeling)
Gotta work me out, make it real (What, what, what, what, what?)
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling (She got me)

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg & Prince Royce]
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
Stuck on a, stuck on a feeling
She got me
Yeah, yeah, she got me, she got me
Yeah, yeah, she got me, she got me
Stuck on a, stuck on a, stuck on a, stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling (What?)
