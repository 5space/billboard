I blame this new tattoo on a hundred proof bottle of whiskey
And the scar on my cheek to an '84 Jeep and an oak tree
Blame the cussin' on my Daddy, good looks on my Mama
But as for my honky-tonk ways

I blame it on Waylon
And all them other outlaws
Blame it on the back beat
Blame it on them sad songs

If I got a don't care attitude and long hair
And mean every damn word I'm singin'
I blame it on Waylon

I blame my ramblin' ways on that old freight train I was born on
And the holes in the soles of these boots on every girl I told so long
Blame my good luck on the good Lord
And bad luck on the devil, but this lonesome in my soul

You know I blame it on Waylon
And all them other outlaws
Blame it on the back beat
Blame it on them sad songs

If I got a don't care attitude and long hair
And mean every damn word I'm singin'
I blame it on Waylon

From this old guitar I'm playin'
To these smoky bar dues I'm payin'

You know I blame it on Waylon
And all them other outlaws
Blame it on the back beat
Blame it on them sad songs

If I got a don't care attitude and long hair
And mean every damn word I'm singin'
I blame it on Waylon

And all them other outlaws
Blame it on the back beat
Blame it on them sad songs

If I got a don't care attitude and long hair
And mean every damn word I'm singin'
I blame it on Waylon, blame it on Waylon
