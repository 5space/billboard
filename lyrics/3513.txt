[Intro: Post Malone]
Oh

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Wait (Wait)
I know you gotta a lotta shit you’d like to say (To say, to say)
Slow down, think you gettin' lil' carried away
You’re too close, to the flame
But you don’t, wanna turn around
Like you got me figured out

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
But girl, what I can promise is I'll let you down
So don’t put up a fight
You’ll get lost in the light

[Chorus: Post Malone]
If you keep staring at the sun, you won’t see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun

[Verse 2: SZA]
Wait (Yeah, yeah, wait)
I know I got a lot of shit going on with me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Now we're free to loving anyone other than me
I try to rewind, I get reminded that time don't wait for nobody
Can't get too close and don't let it go

[Pre-Chorus 2: SZA]
'Cause I can count on you to let me down
I won't put up a fight
I got lost in the light (Oh)

[Chorus: Post Malone and SZA]
If you keep staring at the sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun

[Bridge: Post Malone, SZA, and Both]
Wait
Got a couple little things I would like to say (Oh yeah)
Today is not your day
You should walk away (Oh yeah)
But you won't listen, you just keep on (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Post Malone and SZA]
Staring at the sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can’t be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun
