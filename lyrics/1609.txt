[FINN]
Highway run
Into the midnight sun
Wheels go 'round and 'round
You're on my mind

[RACHEL]
Restless hearts
Sleep alone tonight
Sending all my love
Along the wire

[FINN & RACHEL]
And they say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And loving a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be

[RACHEL]
Oh boy, you stand by me

[FINN & RACHEL]
I'm forever yours
Faithfully

[RACHEL]
Circus life
Under the big top world

[FINN & RACHEL]
We all need the clowns
To make us smile

[RACHEL]
Oh!
Through space and time

[FINN]
Through space and time

[FINN & RACHEL]
Always another show
Wondering where I am, lost without you
And being a part ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you

[FINN]
Oh girl, you stand by me

[FINN & RACHEL]
I'm forever yours
Faithfully

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[FINN]
Faithfully

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Oh oh oh oh

[RACHEL]
Faithfully

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Oh oh oh oh oh

[RACHEL]
I'm still yours

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[FINN with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Oh oh oh oh oh

[FINN & RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[RACHEL]
I'm still yours!

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

[FINN & RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[FINN & RACHEL]
I'm still yours!
Faithfully...
