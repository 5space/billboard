[Verse 1]
I know I gotta put in the hours
Make the money while the sunlight shines
But anything I gotta get done
It can get done some other time

[Chorus]
Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer
But I got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
She's where I need to be
Time is love, gotta run

[Verse 2]
I only get so many minutes
Don't wanna spend 'em all on the clock
In the time that we spent talking
How many kisses have I lost?

[Chorus]
Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer
But I got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
She's where I need to be
Time is love, gotta run

[Bridge]
Gotta fly
Fly
Before one more moment gets by...

[Chorus]
Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer
But I got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
She's where I need to be

[Chorus]
Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer
But i got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
She's where I need to be
Time is love, gotta run
Time is love, gotta run...
