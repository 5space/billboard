[Verse 1]
Make it stop
Sounds so good, I just can't take no more
Turn it down, turn it up, I don't know
I don't know (Know)
But don't stop, don't move
Just keep it there (Right there)
Keep it right there (Mmh)
Keep it right there

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go
Put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go

[Chorus]
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
I can listen to it all day
I can listen to you all day, yeah, you all day
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
We can start all over again, and again
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay

[Verse 2]
Don't stop (Stop)
Turn it on, turn it up, make it louder
I don't wanna miss a single thing
I wanna hear every melody (Yeah)
B-b-b-beating (Beating, beating)
Beating so loud you can feel it (See it, see it)
B-b-b-beating (Beating, beating)
Beating for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go
Put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go

[Chorus]
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
I can listen to it all day
I can listen to you all day, yeah, you all day
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
We can start all over again, and again
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay

[Bridge]
Feel it all, feel it all crashing down (Down, down)
I'm so lost, I'm so lost in your sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay (Yeah, on replay)
Put this song on replay
List-listen to you all day, to you all day

[Chorus]
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay (Song on replay)
I can listen to it all day
I can listen to you all day, yeah, you all day
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
We can start all over again, and again
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah
