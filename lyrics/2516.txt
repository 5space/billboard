[Verse 1]
Well, I’ve been living like a wild ol’ mustang
Out in Montana fields
Might’a earned me a bad reputation
But never stopped these wheels
From going and rolling too far
Running and gunning a little too hard
So un-reigned, so untamed, yeah

[Chorus]
So God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you

[Verse 2]
Your soul is pure golden
Must’ve been true love you were grown in
Sent the sun rays to a dark place
On the same day, yeah, God made

[Chorus]
God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you
More girls like you

[Bridge]
It’s been a while since I stopped and prayed
But Lord have mercy look at her
He sure didn’t make no mistake when he put that angel on Earth
Yeah, God made …

[Chorus]
God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you
Yeah
