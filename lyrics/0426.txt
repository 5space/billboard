[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys, kicking it back
Or the guy with a guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can
Stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that

[Chorus]
And I’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like, "Ain’t she beautiful?"
I’m invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But, I don’t mind being the guy with the girl, no

[Verse 2]
It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room

[Chorus]
And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like, "Ain’t she beautiful?"
I’m invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But, I don’t mind being the guy with the girl

[Bridge]
The guy that don't know how he got her
But he ain't never gon' let her, never gon' let her go
Woah-oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain’t she beautiful?"
I’m invisible, but, I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But, I don’t mind being the guy with the girl (Guy with the girl)

[Outro]
No, I don't mind being the guy with the girl (Guy with the girl)
Yeah, I'm just the guy with the girl
I'm always the guy with the girl
I don't mind it, baby
I don't mind it, baby
I'm always the guy with the girl
