[Chorus]
Shut up about politics
Ain't nothing but a big pile of dirty tricks
I'm tired of all the fighting and the pitching fits
So shut up about politics

[Verse 1]
You punch left, I punch right
We're caught up in the middle of a deep swamp fight
Some people lie, some people steal
And everybody's talking 'bout the great new deal

[Chorus]
Shut up about politics
Ain't nothing but a big pile of dirty tricks
I'm tired of all the fighting and the pitching fits
So shut up about politics

[Verse 2]
All this fussing and carrying on
It's been going on a little too long
But I got something to fix us all up
Take a shot of my whiskey from a big red cup

[Chorus]
Shut up about politics
Ain't nothing but a big pile of dirty tricks
I'm tired of all the fighting and the pitching fits
So shut up about politics
Shut up about politics
Ain't nothing but a big pile of dirty tricks
I'm tired of all the fighting and the pitching fits
So shut up about politics
Shut up about politics
Ain't nothing but a big pile of dirty tricks
I'm tired of all the fighting and the pitching fits
So shut up about politics
Shut up about politics
So shut up about politics
