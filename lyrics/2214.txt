[Intro]
Come here
I don't know what happened

[Verse 1]
Where did they go?
Nights like this don’t happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me and did I lose control? (Slow it down)

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don’t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

[Chorus]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

[Verse 2]
It's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no flights no more
But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
There's a reason what this happened for, yeah (But I can't help but feel like)

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don’t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

[Chorus]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

[Bridge]
Bounce

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don’t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

[Chorus]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
