[Verse 1]
I'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights
That's alright cause I don't want to be alone
There's nobody waitin there, cold and empty bed
Words I wished I'd said come on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I do this to myself
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're with someone else

[Chorus]
But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So, I've been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and it's breaking my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made won't fill this empty space

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I just can't let you go
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're never coming back

[Chorus]
But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back oh oh
But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back oh oh

[Outro until Fade]
Mmmm
If I could bring you back
Mmmm
Just close my eyes...
