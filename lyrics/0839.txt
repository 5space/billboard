[Verse 1]
She rose out of bed, wipes the sleep out of her eyes
I know she's bound to be tired, but she looks so satisfied
We stayed up a little late last night
I guess I must be doing something right

[Chorus]
Cause my baby's got a smile on her face
My baby's got a smile on her face, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
As soon as I get to work I call her on the phone
I wanna tell her that I love her, I can't wait til I get home
She doesn't say a word when I walk in
Looks like we might not get much sleep again

[Chorus]
Cause my baby's got a smile on her face
My baby's got a smile on her face

[Bridge]
Every time we get together
My baby's got a smile on her face
Yeah, I wanna make it last forever
My baby's got a smile on her (you're gonna take it easy)

[Outro]
Just look at her, gotta look at her
Take a look at that smile on her face
