[Intro]
Ooh, that body's like music to my ear
Ooh, that body's like music to my ear
Ooh, that body's like music to my ear
'Cause what you want is right here

[Verse 1]
Oh she, oh she so international
The way, the way she get it on the floor
I'm tryin, I'm tryin' to holler at you
I wanna get to know you better

[Pre-Chorus]
Parlez-vous français?
Konichiwa, come and move in my way
Hey little chica from Guadeloupe
That thing you got behind you is amazing

[Chorus]
I don't speak Spanish, Japanese or French
But the way that body's talkin' definitely makes sense
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
The way she moves around
When she grinds to the beat
Breaking it down articulately
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
It's her, her body, her body

[Post-Chorus]
That make me want to say hey ('Ey!)
Hey ('Ey!)
Hey ('Ey!)
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
C'mon

[Verse 2]
Shorty, let me whisper in your ear
Tell you everything you wanna hear
You got my vote: Hottest Girl of the Year
Let's have a celebration, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Parlez-vous français?
Konichiwa, come and move in my way
Hey little chica from Guadeloupe
That thing you got behind you is amazing

[Chorus]
I don't speak Spanish, Japanese or French
But the way that body's talkin' definitely makes sense
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
The way she moves around
When she grinds to the beat
Breaking it down articulately
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
It's her, her body, her body

[Post-Chorus]
That make me wanna say hey ('Ey!1)
Hey ('Ey!)
Hey ('Ey!)
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
C'mon

[Bridge]
I'm lifting up my voice to say
You're the hottest girl in the world today
The way you shake you got me losing my mind
You're bangin' like a speakerbox
Turn around, the party stops
Universal lady, let me take you away

[Chorus]
I don't speak Spanish, Japanese or French
But the way that body's talkin' definitely makes sense
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
The way she moves around
When she grinds to the beat
Breaking it down articulately
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
It's her, her body, her body

[Post-Chorus]
You make me wanna say
(Make me wanna say) He-eey, he-eey, he-eey
(Make me wanna say) He-eey, he-eey, he-eey
It's her, her body, her body, her body language
Her body language, c'mon

[Outro]
Ooh, that body's like music to my ear
Ooh, that body's like music to my ear
Ooh, that body's like music to my ear
'Cause what you want is right here
