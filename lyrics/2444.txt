[Verse 1]
Wreckin' balls, downtown construction
Bottles breakin', jukebox buzzin'
Cardboard sign says "The Lord is Comin'"
Tick, tick, tock
Rumors turn the mills back home
Parkin' lot kids with the speakers blown
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it
Off, off, off

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder how did we get here
Seems like all we ever hear is noise

[Chorus]
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise

[Verse 2]
24 hour television
Gets so loud that no one listens
Sex and money and politicians
Talk, talk, talk
But there really ain't no conversation
Ain't nothin' left to the imagination
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it
Stop, stop this noise

[Chorus]
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise

[Bridge]
Every room, every house, every shade of noise
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise
We can't take the noise, so we just make noise

[Chorus]
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise

[Outro]
All this noise
Can't take the noise
Can't take the noise
Can't stand the noise
Can't take the noise
