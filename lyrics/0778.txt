[Verse 1]
I never thought that you would be the one to hold my heart
But you came around and you knocked me off the ground from the start

[Bridge]
You put your arms around me
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go
You put your arms around me and I'm home

[Verse 2]
How many times will you let me change my mind and turn around?
I can't decide if I'll let you save my life or if I'll drown

[Hook]
I hope that you see right through my walls
I hope that you catch me cause I'm already falling
I'll never let our love get so close
You put your arms around me and I'm home

[Verse 3]
The world is coming down on me and I can't find a reason to be loved
I never wanna leave you but I can't make you bleed if I'm alone

[Bridge]
You put your arms around me
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go...

[Hook]
I hope that you see right through my walls
I hope that you catch me cause I'm already falling
I'll never let a love get so close
You put your arms around me and I'm home

[Verse 4]
I tried my best to never let you in to see the truth
And I've never opened up
I've never truly loved 'til you put your arms around me
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go

[Hook]
I hope that you see right through my walls
I hope that you catch me cause I'm already falling
I'll never let our love get so close
You put your arms around me and I'm home
