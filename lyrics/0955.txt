[Verse 1]
Satisfied
The only feeling I ain't felt for time
But loneliness
You never leave me when I need a fix

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I hit up every name in my contacts
But I can't even get one text back
All I really need is some sex
Ya feel me?
And I could get it going myself
But lately I've been needing some help
'Cause all I want is somebody else
To feel me

[Chorus]
No, I can't take another night on my own
Need another body here to keep warm
Always hated sleeping naked alone
Naked alone
Oh, I've been waiting on a touch for so long
Need another body turning me on
Always hated sleeping naked alone
Naked alone

[Verse 2]
Desperate
I'm clutching sheets and they're about to rip (Oh shit)
So frustrated
I'm losing sleep 'cause I can't concentrate (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I hit up every name in my contacts
But I can't even get one text back
All I really need is some sex
Ya feel me?
And I could get it going myself
But lately I've been needing some help
'Cause all I want is somebody else
To feel me

[Chorus]
No, I can't take another night on my own
Need another body here to keep warm
Always hated sleeping naked alone
Naked alone
Oh, I've been waiting on a touch for so long
Need another body turning me on
Always hated sleeping naked alone
Naked alone

[Bridge]
(Let me hear you say, ooh)
Yeah, uh (Yeah)
(Bow wow)
Yeah (Ooh)
Yeah, what?
(Bow wow)

[Chorus]
No, I can't take another night on my own
Need another body here to keep warm
Always hated sleeping naked alone
Naked alone
Oh, I've been waiting on a touch for so long
Need another body turning me on (Yeah)
Always hated sleeping naked alone
Naked alone
