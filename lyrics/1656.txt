[SANTANA]
Hey-hey-hey you and me keep on dancin' in the dark
It's been tearin' me apart, never knowin' what we are
Hey-hey-hey you and me keep on tryin' to play it cool
Now it's time to make a move, and that's what I'm gonna do

[ARTIE & (BRITTANY)]
Lay it all down, all down (Got somethin' to say)
Lay it all down, all down (Throw your doubt away)
Do or die now, die now (Step onto the plate)
Blow the door wide open like up, up and away

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Let's light up the world toni-i-ight
You gotta give up the bark and bi-i-ite
I know that we got the love alri-i-ight
Come on and li-li-light it up, light it up tonight
Let's light up the world toni-i-ight
You gotta give up the bark and bi-i-ite
I know that we got the love alri-i-ight
Come on and li-li-light it up, light it up tonight

[FINN]
Hey-hey-hey you and me, turn it up ten thousand watts
Tell me why we gotta stop, I just want to let it rock

[TINA & ARTIE]
Hey-hey-hey you and me keep on tearin' at the road
Like we don't know where to go, step back, let me take control

[ARTIE & (BRITTANY)]
Lay it all down, all down (Got somethin' to say)
