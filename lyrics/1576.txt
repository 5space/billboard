[THE WARBLERS]
Whoa
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[BLAINE]
Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied

[KURT]
Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive

[THE WARBLERS]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

[BLAINE & KURT]
No, I won't sleep tonight

[BLAINE & KURT with THE WARBLERS]
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

[THE WARBLERS]
(Whoa)

[BLAINE]
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's gettin heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide

[KURT & (THE WARBLERS)]
I do it every time
You're killin' me now (Killin' me now)

[BLAINE & KURT]
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

[BLAINE & KURT with THE WARBLERS]
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

[BLAINE & KURT]
Hush hush the world is quiet
Hush hush we both can't fight it

[KURT]
(Whoa)

[BLAINE & KURT]
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
No, I won't sleep tonight

[BLAINE & KURT with THE WARBLERS]
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin'

[BLAINE & KURT with THE WARBLERS, (BLAINE)]
Here we go again (Wo, oh)
Here we go again (Wo, oh)
Here we go again (Wo, oh)
Take a bite of my heart tonight

[BLAINE & KURT with THE WARBLERS]
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
