I hope she cheats on you with a basketball playa
Hope that she Kim Kardashianed her way up
Don't know the difference between a touchdown and a lay-up
Got you on Viagra in order for you to stay up
I may sound bitter, I'm a little bitter
Just a little bitter because you were with her
I'm Salt Lake City now I'm on up out the picture
Remember how it was when I was with ya
Baby sex so good, do you remember? Ohhh
Baby sex so good, do you remember? Ohhh
Well look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a baskeball playa)
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope you're feeling lonely baby now were not together)
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basketball playa)
Look at how it all turned out now (Now that I'm without you)
I hope she cheats on you with a NFL balla
She ignores ya every single time you call her
Brand new Louie gotta have it spend ya money on her
When you wanna hit it she acting like she doesn't wanna
I may sound bitter, I'm a little bitter
Just a little bitter because you were with her
I'm Salt Lake City now I'm on up out the picture
Remember how it was when I was with ya
Baby sex so good, do you remember? Ohhh
Baby sex so good, do you remember? Ohhh
Well look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basketball playa)
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope you're feeling lonely baby now were not together)

She cute and all but that won't last forever
What I had for you was so much better
Yeah the grass ain't greener on the other side of town
Now look at how it all turned out now
I'm a little bitter, just a little bitter but I'm doing better cause we ain't together
Ya sorry excuse for somebody I was into
Remember what it was when I was with you
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basketball playa)
