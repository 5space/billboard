[Verse 1]
Maybe I should take that picture off the dashboard
Before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
Yeah, I bet she's still crying on that front porch
Yeah, this time it's gonna take some time to heal

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
There's more than miles in my rear view

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm headed north to what I swore I wanted
And trying not to buy into my doubts
But I just can't seem to keep myself from wondering
Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
There's more than miles in my rear view

[Verse 3]
Yeah, more than miles
Yeah, I've been changing lanes without my mirrors
Cause every time I look behind me I see her
I think I just realized how much I need her

[Chorus]
So I’m turning back for Georgia
Stopping short of Tennessee
I can’t put my dreams before her
Man, I need her with me
Cause that girl’s in every song I sing
She’s in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Can sleep in the back tonight
Now I know what I’m supposed to do, yeah
There’s still more than miles in my rear view

[Outro]
More than miles, yeah
More than miles
