[Intro: Meek Mill & Future]
Yeah, ooh
(Wheezy outta here)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We gon' whack yo' dog about that cash, huh (Brr)
Play I'll put them demons on yo' ass, huh
I got too much power, don't make me mad, huh (Don't make me mad)
I'm too rich to send a hit, you better be glad, huh (Better be glad)
Deep down in them trenches, started up in extensions, (No)
Touch down in the clearport, now we back in business (Business)
Pull up in my hood, these niggas be actin' different (For what?)
They gon' keep it cool 'cause we'll whack them niggas
Huh, livin' to die, nigga, we dyin' to live (Dyin' to live)
Had to sacrifice my life just for my mom and kids (Mom and kids)
Beefin' with some real killers, they at my momma crib
Turn me to a monster, gotta show you niggas what time it is, huh
I got a rush from knowing these niggas wanna hit me up (Boom boom boom)
I was taught, you kill a real killer, and it'll give you luck (give you lved)
Feds gave my nigga thirty years and he stuck (And he stuck)
Still prayin' he don't give me up, huh

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
We gon' whack yo' dog about that cash, huh (Brr)
Send a message to 'em with no mask, huh (With no mask)
You don't wanna see my lil' nigga in yo' grass, huh (In yo' grass)
Hangin' all out the window, swingin' that Mac, huh (Straight up)
Pay you back, nigga gon' pay you back (Pay you back) (21, 21)
Leave 'em with some real rich niggas that'll get you wet (Get you what?)
We ain't ever fittin' with no nigga with like, "Where you at?" (21, 21)
Pay you back, niggas gon' pay you back

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I can't lie, I feel like John Wick with a stick (Straight up)
Bought a trap phone just to greenlight hits (Straight up)
All that talkin' make that chopper give you lip filler (21)
I come from the six, where they kill killers (Straight up)
This AK got so many bodies I call it Charles Manson (Straight up)
We was tryna find a lick, y'all niggas was somewhere dancing (Bitch)
Them young niggas still had respect when they was broke, huh (On God)
The whole city know that 21 gang will smoke sumn
If you want 'em whacked, it's gon' cost ten nickels (Fifty)
Bring a hundred racks, it could get done quicker (Quickie)
Desert Eagle bullets same size as a pickle (Straight up)
We kill all the opps and then we fuck all they sisters (On God)
All the guns I own got hollow tips in 'em (Straight up)
Nigga pick a side or you gon' die in the middle (Lil' bitch)
Dreamchasers shoot 'em wit' the .38 through the pillow
Wish I rapped in the 90s 'cause this 2k shit full of weirdos (Weirdos)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
We gon' whack yo' dog about that cash, huh (Brr)
Send a message to 'em with no mask, huh (With no mask)
You don't wanna see my lil' nigga in yo' grass, huh (In yo' grass)
Hangin' all out the window, swingin' that Mac, huh
Pay you back, nigga gon' pay you back (Pay you back)
Leave 'em with some real rich niggas that'll get you wet (Wet)
We ain't ever fittin' with no nigga with like, "Where you at?" (Where you whoo)
Pay you back, niggas gon' pay you back, huh

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I'm like free all my young niggas that's incarcerated (Free 'em)
See 20 mil by 32, I feel obligated (Yeah)
I say nigga don't want no smoke, you ain't no carburetor (Brr)
Try to kill me, I come right back, Arnold Schwarzenegger (Ha)
AP terminator (Terminator), gon' make me burn a hater (Burn a hater)
Know a bitch shitted on me back then, I had to return the favor (Whoo)
I fucked first night, I ain't hit her back, I don't wanna fight
You can get it back, I ain't beefin' 'bout no dog hoe
Can't find a bitch like Waldo
'Cause she was tryna buy the bitch Aldo
Nigga this that Chanel money
This that "so much work, if you get caught, you better not tell" money
This that out yo' league, I smell like Creed, walk by and smell money
Fly them bales in, right to your doorstep, that's mail money
Young bull did his first hit and he turnt up, huh
If gettin' money was a sin nigga, I'd be burnt up, huh
If you know a nigga from back then, know I was fucked up, huh
Get to pointin' fingers and they swingin' through like a nunchuck (Gang)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
We gon' whack yo' dog about that cash, huh (Brr)
Send a message to 'em with no mask, huh (With no mask)
You don't wanna see my lil' nigga in yo' grass, huh (In yo' grass)
Hangin' all out the window, swingin' that Mac, huh (Boom boom boom)
Pay you back, nigga gon' pay you back (Pay you back)
Leave 'em with some real rich niggas that'll get you wet (Wet)
We ain't ever fittin' no nigga with like, "Where you at?" (Where you whoo)
Pay you back, niggas gon' pay you back, ho
