[Intro]
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it

[Refrain 1]
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
We were young and drinking in the park
There was nowhere else to go
And you said you always had my back
Oh, but how were we to know?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That these are the days that bind you
Together, forever
And these little things define you
Forever, forever

[Chorus]
All this bad blood here
Won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years
Won't you let it lie?

[Refrain 2]
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
If we're only ever looking back
We will drive ourselves insane
As the friendship goes, resentment grows
We will walk our different ways

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But those are the days that bind us
Together, forever
And those little things define us
Forever, forever

[Chorus]
All this bad blood here
Won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years
Won't you let it lie?

[Bridge]
I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore
I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore

[Chorus]
All this bad blood here
Won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years
Won't you let it lie?

[Refrain 1]
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
