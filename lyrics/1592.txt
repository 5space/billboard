[KURT]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings, and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes, and learn to see
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to be free

[KURT with THE WARBLERS, (THE WARBLERS)]
Blackbird, fly (Fly)
Blackbird, fly (Fly)
Into the light (Fly) of the dark black night (Blackbird, fly)

(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., uh, uh, uh!)
(Tarara-rara-rara-raararararaaa)

Blackbird, fly (Fly)
Blackbird, fly (Fly)
Into the light (Fly) of the dark black night (Blackbird, fly)

(Uh, uh, uh, uh...)

[KURT]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings, and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
