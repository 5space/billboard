[SAM]
Do you hear me?
I'm talking to you
Across the water
Across the deep, blue ocean
Under the open sky
Oh my
Baby I'm trying

[QUINN]
Boy I hear you
In my dreams
I feel you whisper
Across the sea
I keep you with me
In my heart
You make it easier
When life gets hard

[QUINN & SAM]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Ooh ooh ooh

[QUINN & SAM, QUINN, SAM]
They don't know how long it takes (They don't know how long it takes)
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye (Every time we say goodbye)
I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you
I promise you
I will
I, I, I!

[QUINN & SAM]
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

[SAM, SAM & QUINN]
And so I'm sailing
Through the sea
(To an island where we'll meet)
You'll hear the music
Fill the air'
I'll put a (flower)
In your hair

[QUINN]
Though the breezes
Through the trees
Move so pretty
You're all I see
As the world keeps
Spinning 'round
You hold me
Right here, right now

[QUINN & SAM]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh
