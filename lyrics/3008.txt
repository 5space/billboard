[Intro]
Okay
Game face
There we go

[Verse 1]
I've got bipolar disorder
My shit's not in order
I'm overweight, I'm always late
I've got too many things to say
I rock mom jeans, cat earrings
Extrapolate my feelings
My family is dysfunctional
But we have a good time killing each other

[Pre-Chorus]
They tell us from the time we're young
To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves
Inside ourselves
I know I'm not the only one
Who spent so long attempting to be someone else
Well, I'm over it

[Chorus]
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are

[Post-Chorus]
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?

[Verse 2]
I can't think straight, I'm so gay
Sometimes I cry a whole day
I care a lot, use an analog clock
And never know when to stop
And I'm passive aggressive
I'm scared of the dark and the dentist
I love my butt and won't shut up
And I never really grew up

[Pre-Chorus]
They tell us from the time we're young
To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves
Inside ourselves
I know I'm not the only one
Who spent so long attempting to be someone else
Well, I'm over it

[Chorus]
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are

[Post-Chorus]
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?

[Bridge]
Eeeeeeh Oooh Ooooohhh Ooooooooh
(Ha ha ha ha ha)

[Chorus]
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are (Secrets are)
Secrets are
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are (Secrets are)
Secrets are

[Post-Chorus]
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?

[Outro]
So, what?
So, what?
(I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are)
So, what?
So, what?
