[Verse 1]
That girl, she's a party all-nighter
A little "Funky Cold Medina,"
Little "Strawberry Wine"-er
That girl, she's a love gunslinger
Neon j√§gerbomb country-okie singer
That girl, she's a walk on the wild slide
She's a day glow radio slow ride
Low ride good time
If you see her, tell her I'm

[Chorus]
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Hard to find, got me spending every night
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Sundown, heaven town, drivin' 'round
Hitting the bars
Shooting the stars, rollin' up on every party wonderin' where you are
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Drivin' me crazy, something says baby, yeah, maybe you're that girl
That girl, that girl, that girl

[Verse 2]
That girl she's a sugar sweet drive-by
Hold my dreams in her blue jeans, oh my
Yellowhammer, south Georgia, Mississippi chick
Drink cherry wine, Louisiana lipstick
That girl likes to drink it up real loud
Blowin' smoke in a backroad gravel cloud
Drop it down, summer heat
I've got a sittin' up high Silverado seat

[Chorus]
Waitin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Hard to find, got me spending every night
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Sundown, heaven town, drivin' 'round
Hitting the bars
Shooting the stars, rollin' up on every party wonderin' where you are
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Drivin' me crazy, something says baby, yeah, maybe you're that girl

[Bridge]
Hair like a field of gold
Body like a honeycomb
Smile like a country song
Baby where you been

[Pre-Chorus]
That girl, that girl, that girl
That girl, that girl, that girl

[Chorus]
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Hard to find, got me spending every night
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Sundown, heaven town, drivin' 'round
Hitting the bars
Shooting the stars, rollin' up on every party wonderin' where you are
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Drivin' me crazy, something says baby, yeah, maybe you're that girl
That girl, that girl, that girl
Yeah, maybe you're that girl
That girl, that girl, that girl
I've been waitin' for that girl

[Outro]
Hair like a field of gold
Body like a honeycomb
Smile like a country song
Baby, climb on in
