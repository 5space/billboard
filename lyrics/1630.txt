[MERCEDES]
Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear his voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

[SAM]
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[MERCEDES]
If they say

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Why? Why?
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why

[MERCEDES]
Does he do me that way?
If they say

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Why? Why?
Tell 'em that it's human nature

[SAM & (MERCEDES)]
Why? (Why?) Why?

[MERCEDES]
Does he do me that way, yeah

[SAM]
Reaching out
To touch a stranger

[MERCEDES & SAM, (MERCEDES)]
Electric eyes are everywhere (Ooh)

[SAM]
See, that girl?
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[MERCEDES]
If they say

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Why? Why?
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why? Oh, why?
Does he do me that way?

[MERCEDES]
If they say

[SAM & (MERCEDES)]
Why? (Why?) Why?

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Tell 'em that it's human nature

[SAM & (MERCEDES)]
Why? (Why?) Oh, why?

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Does he do me that way?

[MERCEDES]
I like livin' this way

[SAM]
I like lovin' this way

[MERCEDES]
Oh, why, oh, why
Oh, why, oh, why

Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch his shoulder

[MERCEDES & SAM]
I'm dreaming of the street

[MERCEDES]
And they say

[SAM & (MERCEDES)]
Why? (Why?) Why? (Why, why, why, why)

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Tell 'em hat it's human nature
Why? Why?
Does he do me that way?

[SAM & (MERCEDES), {with MERCEDES}]
Why? (Dooby-doo-why) Why? (Dooby-doo-why, ooh)
Tell 'em that (It's human nature)

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Why?

[SAM]
Why?

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Does he do me that way?

[MERCEDES]
I like livin' this way

[SAM]
I like lovin' this way

[MERCEDES]
Oh, why, oh, why
Oh, why, oh, why

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Why? Why?
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why?
