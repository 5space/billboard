[Chorus: Kiki.D]
Whatchu' really doing if you talking about doing it?
(oh no l cannot rely on a lie like)
How you really moving?
You just talking, you ain't moving, sit
Sit down, you ain't moving, sit down
Gotta go and pursue it be confident if you choosing it (choosing it)
Gotta go and pursue it be confident if you choosing it
Lit now, they look at my wrist now

[Verse 1: Kiki.D]
See I’m… back like I never left
(Right) Write like I never left
Bars flying way over heads and I got plenty left
(How many more times is she gonna say left?)
If you guessed, 0 then that numbers correct
Lemme get right to it I know you see the improvement
Substance Over Style forever will be the movement
Desperation for designer got 'em drooling
Caught up in confusion
They winning if you losing, snoozing
Alarm clock go off, now its time to show all
I've been making progress back then I was getting no calls
Microphone in my hand, as soon as I dropped the ball
But I’m still KD, every year standing tall
3s up, bet they put me in that starting five
Kill ‘em with bars every shot make me feel alive
Dance with the stars hit 'em with the cha-cha slide
Dab on 'em 'cause we good on this side, pray to the sky

[Chorus: Kiki.D]
Whatchu' really doing if you talking about doing it?
(oh no l cannot rely on a lie like)
How you really moving?
You just talking, you ain't moving, sit
Sit down, you ain't moving, sit down

[Verse 2: Kiki.D]
Punch lines hitting hard like I’m Chris Brown
Ghost writing anytime they wanna hit now
Pay a fee for the 16 like pow
Profit off a topic anytime I spit now
Spot it if I want it gotta cop it
12 made the black kids heartless, regardless
This world would be nothing if it wasn’t for the artists
Cardi B did it so best believe I'll be charting, red carpet
Let the driver do the parking
I still play a couple roles like Clark Kent
What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger Kelly Clarkson
With everything your heart is where it all starts in

[Chorus: Kiki.D]
Whatchu' really doing if you talking about doing it?
(oh no l cannot rely on a lie like)
How you really moving?
You just talking, you ain't moving, sit
Sit down, you ain't moving, sit down
Gotta go and pursue it be confident if you choosing it (choosing it)
Gotta go and pursue it be confident if you choosing it
Lit now, they look at my wrist now

(Lit now, they look at my wrist now)
(Lit now, they look at my wrist now)
