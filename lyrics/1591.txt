[ARTIE]
Ow, ow
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
But is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

[RACHEL]
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee, ah

[ARTIE with RACHEL & NEW DIRECTIONS]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

[ARTIE]
Ooh

[KURT]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

[MERCEDES (with SANTANA)]
And I told about equality
Ain't it true, either you're (wrong or you're right)

[SANTANA (ARTIE)]
Woo (Uh)

[ARTIE with RACHEL & NEW DIRECTIONS]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

[ARTIE]
Hee
Don't bet

[RACHEL]
Heehee

[SANTANA with NEW DIRECTIONS]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So, when the going get rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going get mean

[ARTIE]
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[KURT (with MERCEDES)]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking (Dirt in my eye)

[ARTIE with RACHEL, SANTANA, and NEW DIRECTIONS]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

[ARTIE with MERCEDES & NEW DIRECTIONS]
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

[SANTANA]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo

[RACHEL]
