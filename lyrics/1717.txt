[RACHEL]
Those school girl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on

[MERCEDES]
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?

[KURT]
Oh, it isn't easy, but I’ll try

[RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS, (with ARTIE & SANTANA)]
(If you wanted the sky, I would write)
Across the sky in (Letters)
That would soar a thousand feet high (Soar high)

[ARTIE & RACHEL (& SANTANA) with NEW DIRECTIONS]
To sir, with (love)

[TINA with ARTIE]
The time has come
For closing books
And long last looks must end

[FINN and MERCEDES]
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

[SANTANA]
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That’s a lot to learn

[KURT (RACHEL)]
What can I gift you in return? (Oh)

[RACHEL with ARTIE, SANTANA, and NEW DIRECTIONS (RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS)]
If you wanted the moon, I would try (To make a start)
(But I would) rather you let me give my heart
To sir, with love
