[HOLLY, NEW DIRECTIONS:]
I see you driving round town with the guy I love
And I'm like "forget you" (oh-oh-oh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like "forget you and forget him, too"
Saying if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Huh, now ain't that some shhh (ain't that some shhh)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "forget you" (oh-oh-oh)

Yeah, I'm sorry I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess she's an Xbox and I'm more an Atari
Mmh, but the way you play your game ain't fair
I pity the fool that falls in love with you

(Oops, she's a gold digger)
Well (just thought you should know it)

Ooh, ooh
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little girlfriend

I see you driving round town with the guy I love
And I'm like "forget you" (oh-oh-oh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like "forget you and forget him, too"
Saying if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Now ain't that some shhh (ain't that some shhh)
Although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "forget you" (oh-oh-oh)

Now I know that I had to borrow
And beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
Cause being in love with your face ain't cheap
Nah, I pity the fool that falls in love with you

(Oops, she's a gold digger)
Well (just thought you should know it)

Ooh, ooh
I've got some news for you
Oh, I really hate you right now

I see you driving round town with the guy I love
And I'm like "forget you" (oh-oh-oh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like "forget you and forget him, too"
Saying if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Huh, now ain't that some shhh (ain't that some shhh)
Although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "forget you" (oh-oh-oh)

[ARTIE and MERCEDES, NEW DIRECTIONS]
Now baby, baby, baby
Why'd you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad? (so bad, so bad, so bad)
So bad (yeah, oh)
I tried to tell my mamma
But she told me "This is one for your dad" (your dad, your dad, your dad)
(Yes she did, yes she did)

[HOLLY, NEW DIRECTIONS, SANTANA]
(Uh!) Why?
(Uh!) Why?
(Uh!) Why, baby, baby? (uh-uh!)
I love you
I still love you! (hey, baby!)
