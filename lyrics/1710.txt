[MERCEDES, spoken]
Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?

[SANTANA, spoken]
Uh huh, sure
You know, you look kinda familiar

[MERCEDES, spoken]
Yeah, you do too but, umm, I just wanted to know do you know somebody named...You, you know his name

[SANTANA, spoken]
Oh, yeah definitely, I know his name

[MERCEDES, spoken]
I just wanted to let you know he's mine

[SANTANA, spoken]
Huh... No no, he's mine

[SANTANA & MERCEDES]
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[MERCEDES]
Think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?

[SANTANA]
But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
'Cause you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

[MERCEDES]
See, I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame

[SANTANA]
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna take his time that's so good
All my love was all it took (The boy is mine)

[MERCEDES & (SANTANA)]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (Boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Confused)
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[SANTANA]
Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it, girl it's true

[MERCEDES]
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

[SANTANA]
You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

[MERCEDES]
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine (The boy is mine)

[SANTANA (MERCEDES)]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (To see)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)

[MERCEDES (SANTANA)]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Had about enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (He's mine, he's mine, he's mine, he's mine)
I'm sorry that you (I'm so sorry)
Seem to be confused (You seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine

[SANTANA]
You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

[MERCEDES]
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start

[[MERCEDES] & (SANTANA)]
You need to give it up (Baby don't lie)

The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you [Mine]
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me [He belongs to me]
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
You need to give it up (Not yours)
Had about enough [But mine] (not yours)

Seem to be confused
