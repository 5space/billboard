* known as 'I Am the Champion' on the NBA Live 2010 Soundtrack

[Intro] [Sportscaster talking]
Incredible! Incredible! Oh my God. Ladies and gentlemen
You have just witnessed world history being made
Bobby Simmons, takes it to the hole, dunks it
Overtime three seconds left, oh my God! Yeah!

[Hook]
I am the champion (champion, champion) (okay)
I am the champion (champion, champion) (did he just get serious in here?)
Lights, cameras, action (action, action) (I think it did)
Whenever I play
Now say. I am the champion (I am the champion)
I am the champion (I am the champion)
I say I am the champion (I am the champion)
I am the champion (I am the champion)

[Verse 1]
Okay Bob hit the stage now
Lights and cameras on
Yes I'm givin them want they want
But no, I will not ever conform
Cause I'm outside of the norm still
What a spectacular form
From the blood sweat and the tears shed
Every time I perform
And whenever your doin' your thang
Yep, people gonna hate on it usually (that's right)
But I'm just as human as you
I just look good while doin' it
And they telling me I have so much dope I won't know what to do with it
Well until then
I'm gonna continuin' maneuverin'
Because

[Hook]
I am the champion (champion, champion) (What a spectacular athlete)
I am the champion (champion, champion) (If I do say so myself)
Lights, cameras, action (action, action) (hahaha, seriously)
Whenever I play
I say. I am the champion (I am the champion)
I am the champion (I am the champion)
I say I am the champion (I am the champion)
I am the champion (I am the champion)

[Verse Two]
I look in the mirror and laugh
Like look at what I've become
Everyone calls me Bob but I'm still my mother's son
And I'm low key when I'm out now, hell no, fame ain't fun
But I stay Live like NBA on yo' Playstation
And I entertain' cause I'm in the game
It's easy to see I ain't into fame
Cause I ain't
And critics say that I imitate, but I really can't
Please allow me to demonstrate
But no matter what they say
I stay charged up like a triple A
Really maine?
Really maine

[Hook]
I am the champion (champion, champion) (I wake up and piss excellence)
I am the champion (champion, champion) (All day)
Lights, cameras, action (action, action) (Please hold your applause)
Whenever I play (I'm kind of a big deal)
I say. I am the champion (I am the champion)
I am the champion (I am the champion)
I say I am the champion (I am the champion)
I am the champion (I am the champion)

[Sportscaster talking]
Wow, it seems like the crowd is pandemonium!
This is pandemonium!
The crowd is rushing the court
And it seems like they're chanting for...
What?! What?!

[Bridge]
Hoo hoo you be too scared you need to go home
Hoo hoo you be too scared you need to go home
Hoo hoo you be too scared you need to go home
Jeah you need to go home

[Hook]
I am the champion (champion, champion) (Hey what can I say?)

Lights, cameras, action (action, action) (Please, no interviews)
Whenever I play (hahaha)
