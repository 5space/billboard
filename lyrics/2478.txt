[Verse 1]
Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Verse 2]
Oh, we both care about it
But arguing with me just isn't worth it
No, no, no
Don't go reachin' in your bag, your bag, yeah
I didn't text you back 'cause I was workin'
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Bridge]
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
(Gave you all my time and all my love)
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin' (Vibin')
Gotta put my phone on silent (On silent)
So my, my, my, my bad (My bad)
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin' (Blowin' me up)
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Outro]
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
My bad, my bad
Alright
