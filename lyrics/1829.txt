[Verse 1]
I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me's on their honeymoon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart-shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me

[Verse 2]
Well, I don't know how I landed on this movie set
It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never woulda noticed if we'd never met
But everybody's got somebody but me

[Chorus]
And I miss you
Without you, I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

[Verse 3]
I hear love songs playing on the radio
People slow dancing everywhere I go
Well, I'm a good slow dancer, but you'd never know
'Cause everybody's got somebody but me
Yeah, they do
Everybody's got somebody

[Chorus]
And I miss you
Without you, I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

[Verse 4]
Sittin' here lonely at a table for two
Watching lovers being lovers in the corner booth
Seems like even cupid don't know what to do
Everybody's got somebody but me

[Bridge]
Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever find another you
But everybody's got somebody but me
Everybody, got somebody
Oh everybody, everybody, everybody but me now

[Outro]
(Everybody's got somebody)
Everybody has got somebody
(Everybody but me)
Everybody but me
(Everybody's got somebody)
Everybody
I miss you
(Everybody but me)
Everybody's got somebody but me
