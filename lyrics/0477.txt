[Chorus: Brandy]
If you put it down right like the way I want it
Play your cards right, maybe we can fall in love

[Verse 1: Brandy]
Ooh, your talk (Talk) game is so tough, damn, I love it all (All)
Even the way you flex (Flex), that's what turn me on
Ooh you know you make me weak, just 'cause the way you are (Are)
'Cause everybody in here know that you're a star
But still I'm letting you know, I got the sweetest heart (Heart)
Any man that wants his babe, he gon' have to work hard
From what I see, you got what I want, but that's just half the part
Gotta see what you put on it to make sure you're the one-e

[Chorus: Brandy]
If you put it down right like the way I want it
Play your cards right, maybe we can fall in love
I-I-If you put it, put it, i-i-if you put it down
I-I-If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I-I-If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I-I-If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love

[Verse 2: Brandy]
I-I-I hope that chivalry ain't dead to you, boy 'cause I'm grown
Gotta pull up and then come up with that when I see what I want
Gotta go old school women sometimes, still keep it soul
2012 for me 'cause I still beef it all
And yeah, I still I want you to know, I got the sweetest heart (Heart)
And even though he can buy the coupe for me, he gon' have to work hard
And now I see you got what I want and that's just half the part
I gotta feel what you put on it to make sure you're the one

[Chorus: Brandy]
If you put it down right like the way I want it
Play your cards right, maybe we can fall in love
I-I-If you put it, put it, i-i-if you put it down (So baby, put it down)
I-I-If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I-I-If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love (If you put it down right, oh)
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I-I-If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love (If you put it down right)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Brandy]
Look, a-a-ain't nobody put it down like me though
Why you playin'? G-Girl, you know
With all this money and all your cake
G-Girl, you better stop, I got a big ego
I'm sippin' on that brandy, that liquor comes in handy
A-And girl, I know you fancy, but this party I'm financin'
She told me, it ain't even like that
(I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love)
She been hatin' all night, a friend uptight, all right
(I'ma put it down, down, you gon' fall in love)
So put it down, I took her at the club, told the girl she'd be right back (Yeah)
(I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love)
B-Back to the crib and in the mornin' all this was worth it
(I'ma put it down, down, you gon' fall in love)
Baby, go get your hair did and buy you a couple purses, you just perfect

[Bridge: Brandy]
You, you, you, can be the one I call
When having a bad day and I need a shoulder to cry on
You, you, you, might change the way I feel
Teach me how to let the guard down (I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love)
Ain't gon' lie, it's been tough
I thought someone one I had was the answer to my prayers
I'ma bow down, he wasn't the truth
And I got you, tryna tell me
If I let you put it (You gon' fall in love, I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love)

[Chorus: Brandy & Chris Brown]
If you put it down right like the way I want it
Play ya cards right, maybe we can fall in love
I-I-If you put it, put it, put it, i-i-if you put it, put it (Haha)
I-I-If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love (Look, yeah, girl)
It's the B-R to the E-E to the Z-Y
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I-I-If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love
It's the B-R to the A-N to the D-Y
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love (Ayy, ayy)
I-I-If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love (Ha, leggo)

[Outro: Brandy]
If you put it down right like the way I want it
