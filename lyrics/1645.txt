Friday night you and your boys went out to eat (Oh)
Then they hung out
But you came home around three, yes you did
If six of y'all went out (Ah)
Then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

[BLAINE with NEW DIRECTIONS]
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

[BLAINE]
I'll pack your bags
So you can leave town for a week, yes I am
The phone rings
And then you look at me
You said it was one of your friends
Down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 2-1-3

[BLAINE with NEW DIRECTIONS, (BLAINE)]
Show up on your caller ID? (Oh)

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone, than unhappy

[NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS, (BLAINE)]
I have been through all of this before
(I've been through all this before)
So how would you think
(Don't think about, don't think about it)
That I could stand around and take some more?
(Get goin', get goin')
Things are gonna change
(Things are goin' to change, baby)
'Cause I don't wanna be a fool anymore
(You don't stand no chance boy)
That's why you have to leave
(I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So don't turn around to see my face
(Don't turn around!)

[BLAINE with NEW DIRECTIONS]
There's no more tears left here
For you to see

[BLAINE, (BLAINE with NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS)]
Was it really worth you going out like that, tell me?
Was it really worth you going out like that?
See, I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back (Yeah)
See all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for me
It turns out

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
You were making a fool of me, yeah!

[NEW DIRECTIONS, (BLAINE)]
(Ah, ah, yeah, ah)
It's not right, (It's not right) but it's okay (It's okay)
I'm gonna (I'm gonna, I'm gonna) make it anyway (Yeah)
Pack your bags (Close the door) up and leave (And leave your keys)
Don't you dare (I'd rather be alone than unhappy) come running back to me

It's not right (It's not right), but it's okay (It's okay, baby)
I'm gonna make it (I can pay my own rent) anyway
(I can pay my own rent)
Close the door (Pay my light bills) behind you
Leave your key (Take care my business)
I'd rather be alone
(Oh, oh)
Than unhappy
(Ohhh)
