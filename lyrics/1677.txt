[ARTIE with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
You know, you, you make me feel so good inside, heh
I always wanted a girl like you, such a P.Y.T, Pretty Young Thing, oh!

[ARTIE]
Where did you come from, baby?
And, ooh, won't you take me there?
Right away, won't you, baby?
Tendoroni, you've got to be
Spark my nature, sugar, fly with me

[ARTIE with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
Don't you know, now is the perfect time?
We can make it right, hit the city lights
Then tonight ease the lovin' pain
Just let me take you to the max

[ARTIE & (NEW DIRECTIONS)]
I want to love you (P.Y.T)
Pretty Young Thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C)
Tender lovin' Care
And I'll take you there, oh, ooh

Anywhere you wanna go

[ARTIE]

[ARTIE]
Nothin' can stop this burnin'
Desire to be with you
Gotta get to you, baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin' honey
Come set me free

[ARTIE with NEW DIRECTIONS harmonizing]
But don't you know, now is the perfect time?
We can dim the lights just to make it right
In the night, hit the lovin' spot
I'll give you all that I've got
