[Intro]
Here we go
Uh, ha ha
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be your Monday morning heading back to work
Stuck in traffic goin' slow, nothin' on the radio
I don't wanna be another chore to check off on your list
Of things you gotta do and places that you gotta go
Oh no

[Chorus]
I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine, barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free
I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night
Oh, your Friday night

[Verse 2]
We can rock together, let the good times roll forever
Fill up our cup, make a memory, drink it up
I don't wanna miss another minute, wanna live it with you
'Neath the blue sky fallin' in love

[Chorus]
I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine, barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free
I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night
Oh, your Friday night
One, two, three, uh

[Bridge]
I wanna be your lemonade in the shade
Money in your pocket 'cause you just got paid, babe
Oh

[Chorus]
I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine, barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free
I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night

[Outro]
Oh your Friday night
Hey
Your Friday night
Hey, you friday night
Oh, oh, F-F-F-Friday night
