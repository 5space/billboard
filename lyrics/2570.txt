[Verse 1: Charles Kelley]
I kept waiting on a reason
And a call that never came
No, I never saw it coming
Something in you must have changed

[Verse 2: Hillary Scott]
All the words unspoken, promises broken
I cried for so long
Wasted too much time, should've seen the signs
Now I know just what went wrong

[Chorus: Lady Antebellum]
I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now, I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

[Verse 3: Charles Kelley]
All the nights we spent, just talking
Of the things we wanted out of life (Out of life)
Making plans and dreams together
I wish I'd seen, I was just too blind

[Verse 4: Hillary Scott]
My heart was open, exposed and hoping
For you to lay it on the line
In the end, it seemed there was no room for me
Still, I tried to change your mind

[Chorus: Lady Antebellum]
I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now, I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

[Bridge: Lady Antebellum]
Oh, I don't need you
I don't need you anymore

[Chorus: Lady Antebellum]
I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now, I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

[Outro: Lady Antebellum]
I don't need you
I don't need you anymore
