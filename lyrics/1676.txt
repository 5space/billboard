[WILL & PUCK]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[WILL]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of
Once in a lullaby

[PUCK]
(Lullaby)

[WILL & PUCK]
Somewhere over the rainbow

[WILL]
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true...

[PUCK]
(Come true)

[WILL]
Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are
Far behind me...

[WILL & PUCK]
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me...

[WILL]
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then, oh, why can't I...?

[PUCK]
(I...?)
