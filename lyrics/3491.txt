[Verse 1]
Look, I got what you need to get you hooked
I steal all your heart I'm a crook
On Friday night, I'm sorry, I'm booked
Brooke, maria, y la amiga de ella
Tan rica y enla cuma no juegan
Exlotan y dicen
Pause

[Verse 2]
Hey, mamita would you like to play?
We love to see, would you stay
And if you say okay, we will play night and day
I'm such a dir-dir-dirty dawg
My teeth will unsnap your bra
But for now baby just pause

[Chorus]
Now, go
Stop, drop, pause
Now, go
Stop, drop, pause
Oh, look at that girl, she's like, ah
Look at that girl, she's like, oh
Look at that girl, she's like, ah
Look at that girl, she's like

She got what I like, what I like

She got what I like, what I like
What I like, what I like
Mami over there sometime
Mami over there sometime
She got what I like, what I like, pause
