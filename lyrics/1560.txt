[RACHEL]
There's a fire
Starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

[JESSE]
Finally
I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

[JESSE with THE A.V. CLUB harmonizing]
See how I'll leave
With every piece of you
Don't underestimate
The things that I will do
There's a fire
Starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

The scars of your love
Remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love
They leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[JESSE & RACHEL (The A.V. CLUB)]
We could have had it all, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep, (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[RACHEL]
Baby, I have
No story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And it's gonna make your head burn

[RACHEL with THE A.V. CLUB harmonizing]
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Makin'
A home down there as mine sure won't be shared

[JESSE with THE A.V. CLUB harmonizing]
The scars of your love
Remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love
They leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[JESSE & RACHEL (The A.V. Club)]
We could have had it all, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep, (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it

[JESSE]
With a beating

[JESSE with THE A.V. CLUB harmonizing]
Throw your soul through every open door

[RACHEL with THE A.V. CLUB harmonizing]
Count your blessings to find what you look for

[JESSE with THE A.V. CLUB harmonizing]
Turn my sorrow
Into treasured gold

[RACHEL with THE A.V. CLUB harmonizing]
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

[JESSE & RACHEL (The A.V. CLUB)]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me), Yeah, we could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep), We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me), Yeah, it all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) (Jesse: Eh!)
We could have had it all, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat, (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You could have had it all, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep, (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played and you played and you played
And you played it to the beat
