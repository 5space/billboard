Yo, VIP
Let's kick it

Ice Ice Baby
Ice Ice Baby

[WILL (with NEW DIRECTIONS)]
All right stop, collaborate and (Listen)
Ice is back with a brand new invention
Something grabs ahold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
(Will it ever stop?) Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, huh, and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
(Dance) bum rush the speakers that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
(Deadly) When I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
(Love it or leave it) You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye (The kid don't play)
If there was a problem, (Yo) I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Now that the party is (Jumpin')
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas all (Pumpin')
Quick to the point, to the point no (Fakin')
Cooking MCs like a pound of (Bacon)
Burnin' 'em if you ain't quick and (Nimble)
I go crazy when I hear a (Cymbal)
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
(Rollin') In my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, waving just to say "hi"
(Did you stop?) No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead, yo, so I continue to A1A (Beachfront Avenue)
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
(Jealous?) 'Cause I'm out gettin' mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
(Ready) for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight balls {Eight balls}
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine, all I heard were shells
(Falling) on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
(Police on the scene) You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical (Poet)
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't (Know it)
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical (Spill)
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and (Feel)
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step (With this)
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJs say ("Damn")
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the (Gram)
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem (Yo, I'll solve it)
Check out the hook while DJ revolves it

Too cold, too cold
