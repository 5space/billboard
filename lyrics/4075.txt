[Intro]
Mm, yeah, yeah-eh-eah

[Verse 1]
I was born off an old dirt road forty acre farm
No highway, no interstate
And I drive an old rusted out Chevrolet
The boys all rubberneck while their out makin' hay

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2]
There's a little cotton dress hangin' in my sisters closet
I think I'm gonna borrow it and wear it this weekend
Painted my toes, bought some cherry lip gloss
No rose, no daisy, touch what I got

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm just a girl who needs a little sun, a little rain
An open field to play

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower

I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I'm a wildflower
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I'm a wildflower
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I'm a wildflower
