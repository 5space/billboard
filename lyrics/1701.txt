[JOE & (SAM)]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote
Make me your radio (Yeah)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[SAM & (MERCEDES)]
Gym Class Heroes, baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf (Oh)
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that? (Uh)
Like it Yeah!, check it Trouty, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks (Uh)
Its just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that (Oh yeah)
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

[MERCEDES]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand

[SAM & (MERCEDES)]
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you (Oh, woah)

[JOE with MERCEDES (SAM)]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote (Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)
Make me your radio (Radio)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[JOE]
Oh oh oh oh oh

[JOE with MERCEDES]
To my stereo

[JOE]
Oh oh oh

[JOE with MERCEDES]
So sing along to my stereo

[SAM, (JOE), {MERCEDES}, Quinn]
Let's go!
If I was an old school fifty pound boombox (Remember them?) {Ooh}
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops (Turn it up!) {Yeah yeah yeah}
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop {Yeah}
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me (Hey)
When you have to purchase mad D batteries {Oh}
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate

[MERCEDES]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hands

[SAM & (MERCEDES)]
Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Oh)

[JOE with MERCEDES, (SAM)]
My heart's a stereo (Uh)
It beats for you, so listen close (Listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote (Oh oh)
Make me your radio (Come on)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you (For You)
Just sing along to my stereo (Sing along like)

[JOE & (SAM)]
Oh oh oh oh oh (Yeah haha)

[JOE with MERCEDES]
To my stereo

[JOE]
Oh oh oh

[JOE with MERCEDES]
So sing along to my stereo

[JOE & (SAM), {MERCEDES}]
I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find) (Mercedes: Oh)
I take your head and hold it closer to mine {Oh, yeah} (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
(Yeah, come on, wooh!) {Yeah!}

[JOE, (MERCEDES), {SAM}, (with MERCEDES)]
My heart's a stereo {Yeah}
(It beats for you, so listen close)
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote (You gotta make me your radio) {Oh oh}
Make me your radio {Aha}
(And turn me up when you feel low) {Turn me up}
This melody was meant for you (Yeah, yeah, yeah) {You}
Just sing along to my stereo (Yeah)
Oh oh oh oh oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
To my stereo (Oh whoa whoa)
{It's yo' boy, Trouty! Gym Class Heroes, baby!}
Oh oh oh (My radio)

[JOE with MERCEDES]
So sing along to my stereo!
