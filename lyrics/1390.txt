[Intro]
Turn it up

[Verse 1]
Somebody save your soul 'cause you've been sinnin' in this city, I know
Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losing control
You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold
I want the good life, every good night, you're a hard one to hold

[Refrain]
'Cause you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap

[Verse 2]
Somebody save your soul 'cause you've been sinning in this city, I know
Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losing control
You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold
I want your sex and your affection when they're holdin' you close (Ha, ha, ha)

[Refrain]
'Cause you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night when the stars come out
Am I the only living soul around?
Need to believe you could hold me down
'Cause I'm in need of somethin' good right now
We could be screamin' 'til the sun comes out
And when we wake we'd be the only sound
I get on my knees and say a prayer: James Brown
That I can make your hands clap

[Chorus]
That I can make your hands clap
Turn it up
That I can make your hands clap

[Verse 3]
My flesh is searchin' for your worst and best, don't ever deny
I'm like a stranger, gimme danger, all your wrong and your right
Secrets on Broadway to the freeway, you're a keeper of crimes
Fear no conviction, grapes of wrath can only sweeten your wine

[Refrain]
But you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night when the stars come out
Am I the only living soul around?
Need to believe you could hold me down
'Cause I'm in need of somethin' good right now
We could be screamin' 'til the sun comes out
And when we wake we'd be the only sound
I get on my knees and say a prayer: James Brown
That I can make your hands clap

[Chorus]
That I can make your hands clap
That I can make your hands clap
(Yeah-yeah, oh, oh, yeah-yeah)
That I can make your hands clap
(Yeah-yeah, oh, oh)
So can I get a handclap?
