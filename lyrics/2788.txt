[Verse 1]
Well, you've been singing that same old song
Far too long, far too long
Say you'll buy me a shiny ring
But your words don't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy

[Chorus]
'Til you take me down (Take me down)
You better take me down (Take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down (Take me down)
Take me down (Take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down

[Verse 2]
Well, you can't ride this gravy train
Anymore, anyway
There's a price for keeping me
I might be cheap, but I ain't free

[Pre-Chorus]
No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy

[Chorus]
'Til you take me down (Take me down)
You better take me down (Take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down (Take me down)
Take me down (Take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down (Come on)

[Verse 3]
Charming devil, silver tongue
Had your fun, now you're done
Mama warned me 'bout your games
She don't like you anyways

[Pre-Chorus]
No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy
No more chicken and gravy
Ain't gonna have your baby

[Chorus]
'Till you take me down (Take me down)
You better take me down (Take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down (Take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down (Take me down)
You better take me down (You better take me down)
Take me down to the little white church

[Outro]
Take me down (Take me down)
You better take me down (Take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down to the little white church
