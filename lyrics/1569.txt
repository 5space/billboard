[DAVID]
¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[DAVID & SANTANA]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[SANTANA]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

[DAVID & SANTANA]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[SANTANA]
Yo quiero estar donde el sol toca cielo
Cuando es hora de siesta tú los puedes ver pasar

[DAVID & SANTANA]
Caras tan bellas, sin importar nada
Where a girl loves a boy
And a boy

[DAVID & (SANTANA)]
Loves a girl (Oooo)
The Spanish lullaby (Hey!)
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro (San Pedro)

[DAVID & SANTANA]
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[DAVID & SANTANA (SANTANA)]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita (Taa-aaa)

[DAVID]
And when the samba played

[DAVID & SANTANA (SANTANA)]
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby (Spanish lullaby)
A na na na na na na na (Te dijo te amo)

[DAVID]
Ooh

[DAVID & SANTANA]
Yeah...

[SANTANA]
La la la la la la

[DAVID & (SANTANA)]
Él dijo que te ama
Ay-yeah, yeah! (Ooh, yeah!)

[DAVID]
La Isla Bonita
La Isla Bonita

[DAVID & SANTANA]
Bonita, bonita
Your Spanish lullaby
