[Verse 1]
I dance around this empty house
Tear us down, throw you out
Screaming down the halls
Spinnin' all around and now we fall

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pictures framing up the past
Your taunting smirk behind the glass
This museum full of ash
Once a tickle, now a rash

[Chorus]
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, fun!

[Verse 2]
Echoes knockin' on locked doors
All the laughter from before
I'd rather live out on the street
Than in this haunted memory

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've called the movers, called the maids
We'll try to exorcise this place
Drag my mattress to the yard
Crumble, tumble, house of cards

[Chorus]
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, fun!

[Bridge]
Oh
I'm crawling through the doggy door
My key don't fit my lock no more
I'll change the drapes
I'll break the plates
I'll find a new place
Burn this fucker down

[Interlude]
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, da, da, da, da
Do-do-do-do, do-do, do
(Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one)
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

[Chorus]
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down
