[Verse 1]
Boy, if you ever left my
My side
It'd be like taking the sun from
The sky
I'd probably die without
You in
My life
'Cause I need you to
Shine, shine
Your light
Oh

[Chorus]
You're everything to me, hey
The air that I breathe, oh
A sign so I'll see, oh Lord
You're everything to me, oh

[Verse 2]
I can't repay you for all that you've done
Always come first and second to none
The love that you give me is equal to ten
My peace, my joy
You are my
My strength, oh

[Chorus]
You're everything to me, whoa
The air that I breathe, oh
A sign so I'll see, oh that
You're everything to me

[Bridge]
(Boy, I never thought)
Never thought I'd feel a love like this
Better than our first date
Sweeter than our first kiss (And you)
Ain't no other person for me
You're my best friend
My lover
(Baby, you're) My everything

[Chorus]
You're everything to me, whoa
The air that I breathe, oh
My sight, so I see, oh
You're everything to me, whoa, I

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Say yeah
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
Whoa, oh, hey
