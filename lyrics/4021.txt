Tessanne Chin:
'Cause I want you safe in my arms
Away from all the shots and alarms
At least you'll die with me
Oh baby die with me, yeah

Ky Mani:
I'm running from the wrong ones and the law
I'm a city boy thats all we need at all costs
Fucking with me could be dangerous, yah
Fucking with me could be dangerous, yah
Girl, I'm addicted to the streets and I'm ducking from the cops
I live my life on the edge
Baby in a minute it could be gone
And baby you've been warned, yah

Tessanne Chin:
You know no other girl could love you like I do
So yourself your most and foo
Cuz in the end i'ma ride with you
I slow roll and so we do

Ky Mani:
Girl your my Bonnie

Tessanne Chin:
Your my Clyde
Boy I got your back through thick and thin

Ky Mani:
Until we die

Both:
And just so we ride [x2]

Tessanne Chin:
And in the darkness your my light

Ky Mani:
Though I'm a soldier when you cry baby I cry

Both:
And just so we ride, yeah [x2]

Tessanne Chin:
Safe is not safe when I'm not with you
I don't want nobody else
This love we share is bullet proof
And I can't do this by myself

Ky Mani:
Girl, I admit it I'm in love with you
I don't need no body else
If something should happen to you 'cuz of me I swear I'd lose myself

Tessanne Chin:
Come to me and let me whisper sweet kisses in your ear

Baby don't ever take to standing on it
And let me take it right here

Tessanne Chin:
Because I want you safe into my arms
So I will bust some shots in your defence
To keep them off
Baby I'm a rider too
And I will die for you

Ky Mani:
Girl your my Bonnie

Tessanne Chin:
Your my Clyde
Boy I got your back through thick and thin

Ky Mani:
Until we die

Both:
And just so we ride, yah. [x2]

Tessanne Chin:
And in the darkness your my light

Ky Mani:
Though I'm a solider when you cry baby I cry

Both:
And just so we ride, yah [x2]

[Unknown]:
I guess the girl
Oh yes I'll be down for you
Tell you from the start of me and you
Gonna lay up on the oven you
I will stand by you
So clear the way make with Gods go true

[Unknown]:
And I love the way she embraces the danger
When baby starts to wild out
Only I can tame her
She's so damned with the face of an angel
So if you see me and you don't see her that could be danger
I'm bringing the pressure, pressure Ms.Piper
I'm below the radar and away from the hype
Our boys that live all they do what they like
Even the blind man can see my stripes

Tessanne Chin:
And just so we ride [x3]
Oh no no no no no
Me and you
Baby, baby
Me and you
Oh no no no
