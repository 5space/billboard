[Intro]
Alabama on the boombox, baby
â€˜Bout to get a little boondock crazy
You're gonna wanna turn this one up
Feels good, don't it?

[Verse 1]
Big stars breakin' out through the indigo
Chevy wind comin' in in stereo
Tail lights disappear in 'bout a mile or so
Down the county road
Phone blowin' up "Where you is?"
Baby, sayin' "Baby, let's do this"
Rocket in a bottle with the fuse lit
'Bout to lift it off, I'm 'bout to twist it off

[Chorus]
Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin' up a faded out 4x4
Girls headin' off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and who brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

[Verse 2]
Well, baby, you ain't nothin but a masterpiece
Swayin' and sippin' that Dos Equis
Losin' yourself in the big loud beat, nothin' but heat (Come on)
Somebody's rockin' that bang box
Everybody hittin' that sweet spot
Nobody mindin' that tick tock
Gettin' all locked in with all my friends

[Chorus]
Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin' up a faded out 4x4
Girls headin' off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and who brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

[Bridge]
Alabama on the boombox, baby
'Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a helluva ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night
Alabama on the boombox, baby
'Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a helluva ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night (Come on)
Come on, y'all, lets go

[Chorus]
Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin' up a faded out 4x4
Girls headin' off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and who brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night (Come on, baby)
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Anything goes on a Friday Night

[Outro]
Alabama on the boombox, baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy
