[Verse 1: Camila & Lauren]
I'm breaking down, gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch
My lips are saying good-bye
My eyes are finally dry
I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me, but I survived
And now I'm coming alive

[Pre-Chorus: Camila]
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Lauren]
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Lauren & Dinah & (Normani)]
I broke the glass that surrounded me (surrounded me)
I ain't the way you remember me (remember me)
I was such a good girl
So fragile but no more
I jumped the fence to the other side, (the other side)
My whole world was electrified (electrified)
Now I'm now longer afraid
It's Independence Day
(It's Independence Day)

[Pre-Chorus: Camila]
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Lauren]
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on

[Bridge: Dinah & (Normani)]
Everything is changing
And I never want to go back
To the way it was (the way it was)
I'm finding out who I am and who I am
From here on out is gonna be enough (gonna be enough)
Is gonna be enough...

[Pre-Chorus: Normani & Ally]
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Lauren & (Dinah) & (Ally) & (Camila) & Normani]
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh (ohhhhh)
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh (on and on and on and on and on)
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh (on and on and on and on, on and on and on and on)
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh (hey... yeah yeah)

[Outro: Lauren]
Yeah, I'm movin' on
