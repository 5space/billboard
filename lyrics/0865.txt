Lonely soldier go home
Lonely, but never alone
Good eyes see nothing to shoot
Good feet feel good giving up good boots
So ask your father how'd you fall
Ask your father how'd you fall
Like a leaf sitting on the ground
Good for nothing 'cept kicking around
She died with her hands stretched out
She died with a hungry mouth
She died with her mind full of doubt
And thoughts of weakening
So may your river never dry
And may your mouth never lie
And may you be satisfied to never know why
Sometimes someone just wants to die
So where'd you get those cuts in your hand
I thought I told you about playing in the sand
There's always someone careless with glass
There's always questions you don't want to ask
She died with her hands stretched out
She died with a hungry mouth
She died with her mind full of doubt
And thoughts of weakening
So may your river never dry
And may your mouth never lie
And may you be satisfied to never know why
Sometimes someone just wants to die
So lonely soldier go home
Lonely, but never alone
Good eyes see nothing to shoot
Good feet feel good giving up good boots
