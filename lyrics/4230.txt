[Verse 1]
Forever can never be long enough for me
Feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now we won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that the weight has lifted
Love has surely shifted
My way

[Chorus]
Marry me, today and everyday
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will, mmhm, say you will, mmhm

[Verse 2]
Together can never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and I'll wear out the words "I love you"
And "you're beautiful"

[Pre-Hook, with variation]
Now that the wait is over
Love has finally shown her
My way

[Chorus]
Marry me, today and everyday
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will, mmhm, say you will, mmhm

[Bridge]
Promise me, you'll always be
Happy by my side
I promise to sing to you
When all the music dies

[Chorus]
Marry me, today and everyday
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will, mmhm, say you will, mmhm

[Outro]
Marry me, mmhm
