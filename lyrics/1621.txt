[PUCK]
Yeah, can you feel it baby?
I can too

[FINN]
Come on swing it
C-come on swing it
Come on swing it
C-come on swing it

[PUCK]
One, two, three
Now we come to the pay off

[MERCEDES]
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation

[PUCK]
Yo! It's about that time
To bring forth the rhythm and the rhyme
I'm a get mine, so get yours
I wanna see sweat comin' out your pores

[FINN]
On the house tip is how I'm swingin' this
Strictly hip hop boy, I ain't singin' this
Bringing this to the entire nation
Black, white, red, brown, feel the vibration

[FINN & PUCK]
Come on, come on
Feel it, feel it
Feel the vibration

[MERCEDES]
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation

[PUCK]
The vibration's good like Sunkist
Many wanna know who done this
Pucky Puck, and I'm here to move you
Rhymes will groove you, and I'm here to prove to you
That we can party on the positive side
And pump positive vibes, so come along for the ride
Making you feel the rhythm is my occupation
So feel the vibration

[FINN & PUCK]
Come on, come on
Feel it, feel it
Feel the vibration

[MERCEDES]
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation

[PUCK]
Finnie D break it down...

[FINN]
Finnie D's on the back up
Drug free, so put the crack up
No need for speed, I'm anti-D-R-U-G-G-I-E
My body is healthy, my rhymes make me wealthy
And the Funky Bunch helps me
To bring you a show with no intoxication
Come on, feel the vibration
Yeah, can you feel it baby?
I can too

[MERCEDES]
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation

[PUCK]
Now the time has come for you to get up
The rest had you fed up but yo, I won't let up
On the rhythm and rhyme that's designed to
Make your behind move to what I'm inclined to
Pure hip hop, no sell out
If you ain't in it to win it, then get the hell out
I command you to dance, I wanna see motivation
Come on now, feel the vibration

[MERCEDES, (FINN & PUCK)]
It's such a good vibration (Come on, come on, come on)
It's such a sweet sensation (Feel it, feel it)
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation (Feel the vibration)
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
It's such a good vibration...
