[Verse 1:]
Girl I've never seen you in this town
If you need somebody to show you around
Well, I know somebody
It's a little too loud to talk in here
And your eyes are saying you wanna disappear
Well, I know a place and
I know somebody

[Chorus:]
Somebody with a gassed up truck
Sitting right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody
And you're looking right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody)
I know somebody (I know somebody)

[Verse 2:]
I'm loving the way you act so shy
Like you ain't so sure
Like you can't decide
But I heard you tell your friends
That you know somebody
That makes you laugh
That can get you home
That might make you fall ‘fore the night is gone
So come on, you know
I'm that somebody
Yeah

[Chorus:]
Somebody with a gassed up truck
Sitting right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody
And you're looking right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody)
I know somebody (I know somebody)

[Bridge:]
I know somebody
That's looking for a girl like you
Could fall in a kiss or two
Baby tell me what you wanna do
Cause I know

[Chorus:]
Somebody with a gassed up truck
Sitting right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody
And you're looking right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody)
I know somebody (I know somebody)

[Outro:]
I know somebody (I know somebody)
I know somebody (I know somebody)
I know somebody
And you’re looking right in his eyes
I know somebody I know somebody)
I know somebody (I know somebody)
I know somebody
