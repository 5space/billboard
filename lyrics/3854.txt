[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Biggest boss and I've been the trillest
I'm a bigger problem when I click with Skrillex
Murder on my mind, it's time to pray to God
My revolver's not religious, the revolution's born
You wanna know my name then go and tell the sarge (What?)
You wanna know my gang: Suicide Squad
Pistol on my waist, I might make a mistake (What?)
Deadshot, head shot, oh my God, am I crazy? (Oooh)
Drugs every corner, this is Gotham City
Killer Croc came to kidnap you to cut out your kidney (Oooh)
Ain't no mercy, got that purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Rozay, don't you know that pussy worth it? (Oooh)
Flooded Rolex at the Grammy awards
They still sellin' dope, that's those Miami boys
Killers everywhere, it ain't no place to run
Forgive me for my wrongs, I have just begun

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini lurkin' (Rozay!)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Don't be beggin' for your life 'cause that's a lost cause
High stakes, body armor, suicide, boy (Ha, ha, ha)
It's a time for games and it's a time to kill (Bang)
Make up your mind, baby, 'cause the time is here
Capital murder, capital letters
Yeah, she catchin' my vibe, but she can't fathom my cheddar (Woah)
Need a couple gang members for these new endeavors
From this point on anything we do we do together (Oooh)
Body on the corner, million in the trunk
Seven figures, I spend that every other month (Skrillex)
Killers on the corner, talons in the clip
Build a palace out in Paris just to fill with bitches (Ha, ha, ha)
Say my name and Iâ€™m coming with the gun squad
Everybody runnin', homie, there's only one God
Cocaine white Ferrari, I'm in the fast lane (Nyu)
Every day was life and death, that's when the cash came (Bang)
Count money, drug residue, even blood on 'em
He had a driver 'til I put my cuz on it
Kickin' in the door, boy, Suicide Squad (Woah)
Needle in my arm so I'm do or die for it

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini lurkin', (Rozay!)
