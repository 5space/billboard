[Intro]
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck your love, fuck it, I don't want none of it (Yeah)
Fuck your trust, fuck it, I don't want none of it, no (Yeah)
Fuck you, fuck you, I don't need your love, ho, yeah (Don't need your love, don't need your love)

[Chorus]
Yeah, but who needs love? (Love)
That ain't never changed shit (Yeah)
Still the same, I never changed, bitch (Yeah)
I been roamin' 'round with the same clique
I been rollin' 'round with the gang, bitch
Fuck your squad and who you came with
In a foreign car, I'm switchin' lanes quick
And I'm destined for this fucking greatness, ayy

And I don't got time for a bitch that's gon' slow a nigga like me down (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I keep on speed racin' to the motherfucking cash, nigga, I'm a fuckin' cash cow, uh
Stuntin' like my motherfucking daddy, bitch (Like my dad)
Spent a hundred on a ring and a Patek wrist (On a Patek wrist, yeah)
And the chopper on my hip is automatic, bitch (Automatic, bitch, yeah)
Get to brrah, I get to blastin' shit (Bah), yeah
Don't fuck with me, don't say that (Don't say that)

Way back when I was eatin' it up, beatin' it up, ayy (Woo)
Eatin' it up, beatin' it up, ayy (Woo)
Feastin' it up, feastin' it up, ayy (Woo)
Livin' it up, livin' it up, ayy (Yeah)

Fuck you, fuck you, I don't need your love, ho, yeah (Don't need your love, don't need your love)

[Chorus]

That ain't never changed shit (Yeah)
Still the same, I never changed, bitch (Yeah)
