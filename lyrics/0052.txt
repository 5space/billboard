[Intro: All]
When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
Oh, when the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys, hey

[Verse 1: Luke, Michael, Calum & Ashton]
When you’re talking to your girls
Do you talk about me?
Do you say that I’m a sweetheart?
Do you say that I’m a freak?
Do you tell them white lies?
Do you tell 'em the truth?
Do you tell 'em that you love me
The way I been lovin’ you?

[Pre-Chorus: All]
'Cause every night you and I find ourselves
Kissing and touching like no one else
Falling and falling until I fell
For you

[Chorus: Luke, Ashton & All]
'Cause I been talking to my friends
The way you take away my breath
It’s something bigger than myself
It’s something I don’t understand, no, no
I know we’re young and people change
And we may never feel the same
So, baby, tell me what you say
When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
I can hear ‘em talking
Oh, when the girls
When the girls
When the girls talk
When the girls talk boys, hey

[Verse 2: Calum, Luke, Ashton & (Michael)]
When you’re talking to your girls
Do you talk about me?
Do you tell I’m your lover?
That I’m all that you need?
Do you tell ‘em white lies?
Do you tell ‘em the truth?
(Do you tell 'em that you love me)
The way that I’ve been loving you?

[Pre-Chorus: All]
'Cause every night you and I find ourselves
Kissing and touching like no one else
Falling and falling until I fell
For you

[Chorus: Luke, Ashton & All]
'Cause I been talking to my friends
The way you take away my breath
It’s something bigger than myself
It’s something I don’t understand, no, no
I know we’re young and people change
And we may never feel the same
So, baby, tell me what you say
When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
I can hear ‘em talking
Oh, when the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
When the girls talk boys
Talk talk talk talk
Talk talk talk talk
When the girls talk boys
Talk talk talk talk (when the girls)
Talk talk talk talk, hey
