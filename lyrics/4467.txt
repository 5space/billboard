Gotta condo down near the stars

Gotta car, I ain't even gotta park
No key push button to start
She ain't a dime I won't get hard
Got hoe's dat need a green card
Say Ima dogg but I don't even bark
Got em biting this swag like sharks
When I hit it ima knock it out the park
Trap beat so got damn hard
Got kush, got lean, got bars
Got remix hard to scale
Got bricks don't need no scale
I'm plugged in with the mayor
I'm part of the cartel
That rerock ain't no clean
62 hundred for a neen
Said fuck it all up on jeans
Ima true religion fiend
Got bands in the pockets of my jeans
Need a kickstand way I lean
Promethazine fiend, styrofoam, sprite and lean

[Chorus]
Got campaigne going so strong
Getting brain while I'm talking on da phone
Spend money when ya money's long
Real street niggas ain't no clone
We at da top where we belong
Straight lean, rozay', patron
Smoking on thousand dollas worth of strong
When da club bout to hear dis sooonngg

Got racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Got racks on racks on raaaaaacks(x3)

No choice by force I sport
To go and cop sum ice
Designer on my mojo
I live in the spotlight
Real street nigga ain't no flaw
Yung future gotta keep dat raw
My swag I gave to you niggas
Ima need me a round of applause
Bravo (bravo) bravo (bravo) bravo/ bravo bravo
Gotta hundred dollars worth of clothes
I'm froze (I'm froze) I'm kold
I keep me a big bank roll
I ain't tricking off on these hoes
These hoes bringing me they soul
I wil never sell my soul
Cash out on all these cars
These foreign (foreign) broads
Gotta nigga living in the stars
I'm on my way to mars
Got keyshia, pam and nicki
They all wanna do a minaj
A.1., free band, free vans... we ain't never gotta got dam flarge

[Chorus]
Got campaigne going so strong
Getting brain while I'm talking on da phone
Spend money when ya money's long
Real street niggas ain't no clone

Smoking on thousand dollas worth of strong
When da club bout to hear dis sooonngg

Got racks on racks on racks

Had to wake up on a bean
Got racks off in my jeans
They busting out the seeeeams
Got kush all in my lungs
Get high like cheech and chong

Catch mine and then I'm gone
This girl want leave me lone

Strapped up no bodyguuaaaard

[Chorus]
Got campaigne going so strong
Getting brain while I'm talking on da phone
Spend money when ya money's long
Real street n****s ain't no clone
