[Verse 1]
She's sick of this town, she's sick of that boy
Yeah, she's sick of dreams that never take flight
There's gotta be more than the same old story
So she's gonna turn the page tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And turn the radio up (Turn the radio up)
Roll the windows down
She got a full tank of gas (She got a full tank of gas)
Ain't no stopping her now

[Chorus]
She got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do
Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes
Are leaving nothing in that rear view
But dust, nothing but dust

[Verse 2]
She's fighting back tears, she's fighting back years
Of the only life she's ever known
But there's a future that's bright in the dead of this night
And all she's gotta do is go

[Pre-Chorus]
And turn the radio up (Turn the radio up)
Roll the windows down
She got an open road (She got an open road)
Ain't no stopping her now

[Chorus]
She got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do
Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes
Are leaving nothing in that rear view
But dust, nothing but dust

[Bridge]
She got the radio up
She got the windows down
No, she won't look back
Ain't no stopping her
Ain't no stopping her now

[Chorus]
She got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do
Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes
Are leaving nothing in that rear view
But dust, nothing but dust
But dust, nothing but dust
