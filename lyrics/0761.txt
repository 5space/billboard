[Verse 1]
You could say I'm a little bit crazy
You could call me insane
Walking around with all these whispers
Running around here in my brain
I just can't help but hear 'em
Man, I can't avoid it, I hear voices
I hear voices

[Chorus]
Like, my dad saying work that job
But don't work your life away
And momma telling me to drop some cash
Into the offering plate on Sunday
And Granddad saying you can have a few
But don't ever cross that line
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

[Verse 2]
Turns out I'm pretty dang lucky
For all that good advice
Those hard to find words of wisdom
Hold up here in my mind
And just when I lost my way
Or I got too many choices, I hear voices
I hear voices

[Chorus]
Like, my dad saying quit that team
And you'll be a quitter for the rest of your life
And Momma telling me to say a prayer
Every time I lay down at night
And Grandma saying if you find the one
You better treat her right
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

[Bridge]
Sometimes I try to ignore them
But I thank God for them
'Cause they made me who I am

[Chorus]
My dad saying work that job
But don't work your life away
And Momma telling me to drop some cash
In the offering plate on Sunday
And Granddad saying you can have a few
But don't ever cross that line
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

[Outro]
Yeah, I hear voices all the time
All the time
