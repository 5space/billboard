[Verse 1]
I held you down for the longest
And I was there through all of your darkest moments
Feels just like yesterday when we were homeless
Gotchu some bread and start treating me bogus
Talking 'bout you wanted something new (something new)
Like I wasn't good enough for you (good for you)
Guess you done caught you a case of amnesia
Maybe you should take a look in your rear view
'Cause obviously you forgot all the times that I held you when you cried
And don't you remember that even if you was in the wrong I stood by your side?
No I guess not, I guess not, 'cause you let them thots take my spot
Congratulations to you, what you wanted is what you got now (you got now babe)

[Chorus]
So you don't gotta worry 'bout me (oh, oh woah)
You made it clear that you're unhappy (unhappy, yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now (fun now)
Just remember what goes around, comes around
You don't gotta worry 'bout me (don't gotta worry, baby)
You made it clear that you're unhappy (you're unhappy, yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now)
Just remember what goes around, comes around

[Verse 2]
I remember when you said that you could have somebody better
And I can't even lie to you it really messed my head up
Had me lookin' in the mirror disgusted with myself
Wishin' that I looked like someone else
Like the girls you liked on Instagram (damn)
And you really had the nerve to call me insecure
Maybe it wasn't you
Maybe it's true I didn't know my worth (didn't know my worth)
Maybe, maybe I should've loved me first (loved me first)
Maybe, maybe I should've loved me first

[Chorus]
So you don't gotta worry 'bout me (oh, oh woah)
You made it clear that you're unhappy (made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now)
Just remember what goes around, comes around
You don't gotta worry 'bout me (you don't gotta worry, no)
You made it clear that you're unhappy (made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now, yeah)
Just remember what goes around, comes around (come around)

[Outro]
Around, around, (yeah) around
What goes around it comes around, ay
Around, around, (yeah) around
What goes around it comes around, yeah
Around, around, (yeah) around
Ooh
