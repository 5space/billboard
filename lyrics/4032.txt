[Verse 1]
I remember when my heart caught the fever
You were standing all alone in the summer heat
I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend
He was as sweet as he could be
But one look at you and I was through
My heart switched up on me

[Chorus]
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now, I'm ruined
I'm ruined

[Verse 2]
In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me?
I should've gone over, right over
I shoulda never let you leave
But it's the never-knowing that keeps this going
And drives me crazy

[Chorus]
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around

[Bridge]
Just when I thought things were alright
My eyes play tricks on my mind, yeah
Will I ever be satisfied 'cause all I ever seem to find is a...

[Chorus]
A postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did
The cruelest thing you ever did
The meanest thing you ever did is come around

[Outro]
I am ruined
Yeah, I'm ruined
Now I am ruined, yeah, I'm ruined
