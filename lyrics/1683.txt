[BLAINE (with THE WARBLERS)]
Right right, turn off the lights
We gonna lose our minds tonight
(What's the dealio?)
I love when it's all too much
5 AM turn the radio up
(Where's the rock and roll?)

Party crasher, panty snatcha'
Call me up if you are gangsta'
Don't be fancy
Just get dancy
Why so serious?

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks
Won't you come on, and come on, and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass!

[BLAINE (with THE WARBLERS)]
Slam slam oh hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
(Wish you'd just freak out)
Can't stop coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
(It's so on right now)

Party crasher, panty snatcha'
Call me up if you a gangsta'
Don't be fancy
Just get dancy
Why so serious?

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS]
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks

Won't you come on, and come on, and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass!

[BLAINE]
My glass is empty...
That sucks!
So if you're too school for cool
And you're treated like a fool

[THE WARBLERS]
(Like a fool)

[BLAINE]
You could choose to let it go

[THE WARBLERS]
(Let it go)

[BLAINE]
We can always, we can always
Party on our own...

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS, (BLAINE)]
So raise your
So raise your glass (glass) if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks
(So raise your) So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, (oh we we) we will never be never be!
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks
(Won't you come on! and come on! and)
Raise your glass!
(Just come on and come on and)
Raise your glass!
(Won't you come on! and come on! and)
Raise your glass!
(For me)
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
(For me)
