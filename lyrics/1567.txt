[WILL]
Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone, it went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way, everybody's got the dues in life to pay

[BRYAN]
Yeah, I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you

[WILL]
Sing with me, sing for the year

[BRYAN]
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear

[WILL]
Sing with me, if it's just for today

[BRYAN]
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[WILL]
Take you away...

[Instrumental Break]

[WILL & BRYAN]
Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year

[BRYAN]
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear

[WILL]
Sing with me, if it's just for today

[WILL & BRYAN]
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away...

[WILL]
Yeah, dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until the dream comes true

[BRYAN]
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come through

[WILL & BRYAN]
Yeah, dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on, dream on, aah!

[WILL & BRYAN]
Sing with me, sing for the year

[WILL]
Sing for the laughter

[BRYAN]
Sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today

[WILL & BRYAN]
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[WILL]
Sing with me

[BRYAN]
Sing for the year

[WILL & BRYAN]
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[BRYAN]
He'll take you away
