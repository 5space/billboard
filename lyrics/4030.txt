[Verse 1]
You've been wearing that crown and tearing me down
It's been a while since you've treated me right
You strung me along for far too long
'Cause I never gave up the fight
Until now

[Verse 2]
It's gonna hit you hard 'til you see stars
Itâ€™s gonna put you through a world of hurt
Oh, I don't believe in getting even
But giving what you deserve
Oh my, oh my, huh

[Bridge]
Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la dee da

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your "just for fun"
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
Done

[Verse 3]
You crossed the line too many times
I'm gonna put you in your place
You play with dynamite, don't be surprised
When I blow up in your face
Oh my, oh my, huh

[Bridge]
Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la dee da

[Chorus]
I don't wanna part of your fun
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done

[Interlude]
Done with your selfish ways
Done and all the games you play
I'm through with you and everything you say

[Bridge]
Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
Mama always taught me that I should play nice
But she didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Scatter the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la dee da

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your "just for fun"
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
Done

[Outro]
Hey, hey, ooh
I wanna be done (So done)
So done (So done)
So done
