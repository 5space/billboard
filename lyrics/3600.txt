[Verse 1: Gary]
I came up out of the water
Raised my hands up to the Father
Gave it all to him that day
Felt a new wind kiss my face
Walked away, Eyes wide open
Could finally see where I was going
It didn't matter where I'd been
I'm not the same man I was then

[Chorus]
I got off track
I made mistakes
Back slid my way
Into that place
Where souls get lost
Lines get crossed
And the pain won’t go away
I hit my knees
Now here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Here I am
Changed

[Verse 2: Gary]
I got a lot of “Hey, I’m sorry's"
The things I’ve done
Man, that was not me
I wish that I could take it all back
I just want to tell em’ that
Tell 'em that

[Chorus]
I got off track
I made mistakes
Back slid my way
Into that place
Where souls get lost
Lines get crossed
And the pain won’t go away
I hit my knees
Now here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Here I am
Changed

[Bridge: Gary]
I'm changed for the better
More smiles, less bitter
I'm even starting to forgive myself

[Outro]
I hit my knee
I’m here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Here I am, Here I am, Here I am
Changed
Yes I am
I’m changed for the better
Thank God I'm changed
