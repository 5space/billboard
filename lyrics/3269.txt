[Intro]
Levels
Levels, levels, levels

[Verse 1]
Get on my elevator
Baby, we're going up
Give me that now and later, I can't get enough
So much to discover, please don't stop me now (Don't stop me)
Every time I touch you, lift right off the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Let 'em go, all the one's tryna get in the door (Oh)
I'ma go where they all couldn't go (Hey)
Up a floor, up a floor, up a floor, oh

[Chorus]
I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
Yeah, there's levels to your love
And I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
And I keep on climbing up

[Post-Chorus]
(Rooftop)
(Up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up)
(Up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up)
(Up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up)
(Up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up)

[Verse 2]
Aww yeah
Just walking up on the ceiling, dancing up on the wall
You and that drug you're dealing, should be against the law
All of this heat keep rising, make you stop, drop, and roll
I’m bottling up the lightning, supernatural

[Pre-Chorus]
Let 'em go, all the one's tryna get in the door (Hey)
I'ma go where they all couldn't go (Yeah)
Up a floor, up a floor, up a floor, oh

[Chorus]
I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love (Levels to your love)
Yeah, there's levels to your love (Levels to your love)
And I know, we can get higher (Higher, baby)
There's levels to your love
And I keep on climbing up

[Bridge with (Post-Chorus in the background)]
(Rooftop)
Levels, levels, levels, levels
Levels to your love
Yeah, heaven can’t reach us
Yeah, we’re high-fiving Jesus
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
And I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
Yeah, there's levels to your love
And I know (I know), we can get higher (Higher)
There's levels to your love
And I keep on climbing up

[Outro]
(Take 'em to the rooftop)
Ooh, levels
There's levels to your love, yeah, yeah
(Levels, levels, levels, levels)
Oh, oh, yeah, get on my level
(Levels, levels, levels, levels)
There's levels to your love, and I keep on climbing up
(Levels)
