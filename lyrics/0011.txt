[Intro: Travis Scott]
Yeah
Do it no hands, yeah, do it, no handstand
They really wanna keep us outside
'Cause you know we go way too live

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
Whippin' again, whippin' and whippin' and whippin' again, yeah
Back at again, back at it, back at it, back at again
All winter, all summer
Range Rovers and black Hummers
Ain't go dumb, I went dumber
When it go down, don't go under (Yeah)
Whippin' again, whippin' and whippin' and whippin' again, yeah
Back at it again, back at it, back at it, back at it again
All winter, all summer
Range Rovers and black Hummers
Ain't go dumb, I went dumber
When it go down, don't go under

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Sell a bird, KFC (Bird)
And it was twenty LLC's (Yeah)
"Alexa, play," who played me? (Me)
Just made a mil' like Meek (Alright)
Pick a side, no in-between
Roll an L with the winning team
She a king like Billie Jean (Billie)
I want smoke, yeah, nicotine (Smoke)
Is you finer than Fashion Nova?
I wanna really see what's in them jeans
Is that a lace front real hair extension, or it's just a quick weave? (What?)
I'm 'bout the S with the lines through 'em
Partition with the blinds pulled
Had a deal on the table from Arm & Hammer, I was gon' sign to 'em
Yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Back at it again, whippin' again, once again, yeah (Yeah)
Out on the East, park up the Benz on the sand, yeah (Yeah)
Skrrt off the block, hittin' your crib, no advance, yeah (Yeah)
Rip off the shirt, rip off the, rip off the, rip off the pants
Do it no hands, yeah, do it, no handstand
While we throw bands in, while we throw bands up
They really wanna keep us outside (Outside)
'Cause you know we go way too live (Too live)
Too turnt up for your club (Too turnt up)
4 AM, ain't fucked up

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
GLE, 63 Benz
Yeah, it really depends (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm covered, I'm drenched
Wet floor signs, hope you don't slip (Slip)
Yeah, my homie a Crip (Woo)
Seafood and you is a shrimp (Damn)
Money tall, you gon' need stilts (Tall)
Rap or Go to the League blimp, uh
Hit a home run off a bunt, yeah (Out of here)
She do whatever I want, yeah
I had the Maybach for five years
I still never sat in the front, yeah
I bought her designer, lil' mama, I'm proud of her
She got a body, pick her out a lineup
She ever leave me, I'm comin' to find her
Whip in the kitchen like chef at Katanas
Yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Back at it again, whippin' again, once again, yeah (Whip it, whip)
Out on the East, park up the Benz on the sand, yeah (Yeah)
Skrrt off the block, hittin' your crib, no advance, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Rip off the shirt, rip off the, rip off the, rip off the pants
Do it no hands, yeah, do it, no handstand (Do it, do it)
While we throw bands in, while we throw bands up
They really wanna keep us outside
'Cause you know we go way too live (Yeah)
Too turnt up for your club
4 AM, ain't fucked up (Yeah)

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Whippin' again, whippin' and whippin' and whippin' again, yeah
Back at it again, back at it, back at it, back at it again
All winter, all summer
Range Rovers and black Hummers
Ain't go dumb, I went dumber
When it go down, don't go under
Whippin' again, whippin' and whippin' and whippin' again, yeah
Back at it again, back at it, back at it, back at it again
All winter, all summer
Range Rovers and black Hummers
Ain't go dumb, I went dumber
When it go down, don't go under
