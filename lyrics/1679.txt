[KURT]
Made a wrong turn once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss "No way it's all good"
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessin'
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around

[BLAINE & KURT]
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect to me

[KURT & (BLAINE)]
You're so mean (You're so mean)
When you talk (When you talk)
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices (Change the voices)
In your head (In your head)
Make them like you instead

[BLAINE & KURT]
So complicated, look how big you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred
Such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons
See you do the same

[BLAINE]
Ohh

[BLAINE & KURT]
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect

[BLAINE & (BLAINE & KURT)]
The whole world's scared, so I (Swallow the fear)
The only thing I should be drinking is an (Ice cold beer)
So cool in line, and we (Try try try)
But we (Try too hard), and it's a (Waste of my time)
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're (Everywhere)
They don't like my jeans, they don't (Get my hair)
Strange ourselves, and we (Do it all the time)
(Why do we do that?) Why do I do that?

[KURT]
Why do I do that?

[BLAINE]
Yeah, ohh...

[KURT]
Oh pretty, pretty please

[BLAINE & KURT]
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect to me

[BLAINE]
Yeah, you're perfect

[KURT]
You're perfect, to me

[BLAINE & KURT]
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect to me
