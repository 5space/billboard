[Intro: Justin Bieber]
I just can't wait, yeah

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holdin' on to me so tight
What more can I do?
'Cause, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Mariah Carey]
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me? Yeah

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Justin Bieber]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby, yeah
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own (For my own, baby)
More than you could ever know (Oh no)
Make my wish come true (Come true)
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, baby

[Outro: Justin Bieber & Mariah Carey]
It's all I want for Christmas, baby
All I want for Christmas is you
It's all I want for Christmas
All I want for Christmas is you
It's all I want baby, yeah yeah
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I really want is, want is, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
