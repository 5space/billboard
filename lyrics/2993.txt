[Intro: Tyga]
You a real bitch, light it up (Light it up)
You a real bitch, go 'n' light it up (Light it up)
It's your birthday, go 'n' light it up (Light it up)
I'm drunk and I'm throwin' middle fingers up
(Mello made it right)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Pass me the kush, we gon' light it up (Light it up)
I'm drunk and I'm throwin' middle fingers up (Fingers up)
Slide in my DM, you can hit me up (Hit me up)
She wanna be the one, she ain't the only one (No)
I got a bop in the trap, got a bop on my lap (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm a dog but I don't got to chase the cat (Nah)
They pull up where I'm at, get the addy from their friends (Yeah)
I don't keep loose change and I don't top loose ends
If a nigga want beef, if a bitch want beef
We put it on the grill, serve that bitch to the street (Blah)
She call me Young Beckham 'cause a nigga go deep (Yeah)
I live by the beat, I'ma kill what I eat (Ayy)

If you a real nigga, go 'n' light it up (Light it up)
It's your birthday, light it up (Light it up)
It's you a real bitch, go 'n' light it up (Light it up)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
She can get it running over to me (Yeah)
She heard about me and she know I'm a freak (Ooh)
She can top, running over me (Over me, yeah)
Girl, you know ain't no controllin' me (No, no)
Close your mouth when I'm facing you (Yeah)

I know you see the smoke in the air, yeah, yeah

Whiskey keeping you balanced
Throw that ass backward while that ass clapping
Ooh, whoa, light it up

If you a real bitch, light it up (Light it up)
If you a real bitch, go 'n' light it up (Light it up, light it up)
