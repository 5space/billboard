[Verse 1]
Don't bother telling me what I got coming in the morning
I already know
I got some feel-good pills and a red gatorade by my bed
Ready to go

[Verse 2]
I'm going to do my best to dance with every girl in this bar
Before they shut it down
Then I'll pay my tab climb in a cab
Heading to a spot downtown

[Chorus]
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight

[Verse 3]
Hey pretty thing
I've been looking at you since the moment that you walked in
I got some wildest buddies that love spending money
And I see you brought a couple of friends

[Verse 4]
Just tell me your name
I don't need your number or a date next Saturday
Baby let's act like fools break a few rules
Party the night away

[Chorus]
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight

[Bridge]
Ha-ha slide

[Chorus]
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
I said tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight

[Outro]
Yeah, it's all about tonight
Come on it's all about tonight
We're going to get our swerve on a buzz on
It's all about tonight
Come on baby I wouldn't worry about that
It's all about tonight
