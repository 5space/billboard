[Verse 1]
Can't be sleeping
Keep on waking
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning
Inside, I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

[Pre-Chorus]
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

[Chorus]
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

[Verse 2]
Can't you see it?
I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
I had no choice in this
I was the friend she missed
She needed me to talk

[Pre-Chorus]
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

[Chorus]
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry, baby, yeah
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
I will be better this time
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
Ooh, I got to say
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
I'm so sorry, oh, I promise
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)

[Chorus]
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
