[KURT]
The power lines went out
And I am all alone
But I don't really care, at all
Not answering my phone

[BLAINE]
All the games you played
The promises you made
Couldn't finish what you started
Only darkness still remains

[BLAINE & KURT]
Lost sight
Couldn't see
When it was you and me

Blow the candles out
Looks like a solo tonight
I'm beginning to see the light
Blow the candles out
Looks like a solo tonight
But I think I'll be alright

[KURT (with BLAINE)]
Been (Black and blue before)
There's no need to explain
I am not the jaded kind
Playback's such a waste

[KURT with BLAINE]
You're invisible
Invisible to me
My wish is coming true
Erase the memory of your face

[BLAINE & KURT]
Lost sight
Couldn't see
When it was you and me

Blow the candles out
Looks like a solo tonight
I'm beginning to see the light
Blow the candles out
Looks like a solo tonight
But I think I'll be alright

[KURT with BLAINE]
One day
You will wake up
With nothing but "Your sorry's"

[BLAINE]
And someday
You will get back

[BLAINE with KURT]
Everything you gave me

[BLAINE & KURT]
Blow the candles out
Looks like a solo tonight
I'm beginning to see the light

[KURT (BLAINE)]
Blow the candles out (The candles out)
Looks like a solo (Solo tonight) tonight

[BLAINE & KURT]
But I think I'll be alright
