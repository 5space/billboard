[Verse 1]
I'm gonna take you for a date
Take you for a ride
Gonna get you over there on the passenger's side
I'm gonna put the radio on your favorite song
I'm gonna crank it on up and get you singing along

[Chorus]
Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Alright (alright)
Girl I'm digging on hittin' on you tonight
It ain't a maybe, it's hopin' I, wishin' I wanna
It's the damn right, hold you tight, baby I'm gonna

[Verse 2]
So what's it gonna take?
What's it gonna be?
We can pump it on the boulevard
Or kick it in the country
Me and you, you and me
Money back, guaranteed
Love you every night in Daytona, I'm gonna

[Chorus]
Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Alright (alright)
Girl I'm digging on hittin' on you tonight
It ain't a maybe, it's hopin' I, wishin' I wanna
It's the damn right, hold you tight, baby I'm gonna

[Bridge]
Love you all night long
Till the crickets start chirpin'
Girl I ain’t just flirting, I’m certain
I’m working on a long term plan
Gonna be your man
Gonna put a little rock steady on your hand

[Chorus]
Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Alright (alright)
Girl I'm digging on hittin' on you tonight
It ain't a maybe, it's hopin' I, wishin' I wanna
It's the damn right, hold you tight, baby I'm gonna

[Chorus]
Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Alright (alright)
Girl I'm digging on hittin' on you tonight
It ain't a maybe, it's hopin' I, wishin' I wanna
It's the damn right, hold you tight, baby I'm gonna

[Outro]
Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Alright (alright)
Oooh
Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Alright (alright)
