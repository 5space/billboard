[Intro: Future & Trippie Redd]
Wheezy outta here
Yeah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I'ma hop out with that MAC-10 (I'ma hop out with that MAC-10)
Pussy get shot for that cappin' (Yeah)
Pussy get popped 'bout that actin' (Pussy get popped 'bout that)
Please say hello to my gat, bitch (Please say hello to my)
I'ma slime his ass, bro, on my slatt shit (Slatt shit)
Bitch not my blood on my blatt shit (Blatt shit)
I'm from 800 block where we whack shit (Whack shit)
If I want it, I take that, we snatch shit (Snatch shit)

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
I'm at the top of the penthouse (Penthouse)
Your nigga pocket on lint ball (Lint ball)
Elliot Diamonds like Kristoff (Elliot)
You cannot trap with no pistol (No pistol)
These niggas lame and they not in my league (My league)
Rich nigga smell like Gelato and cream (Cream)
Freaky lil' bitch and she swallow my seed (Seed)
I keep a gat and a bitch on her knees (Slatt)
We stick together like Cuban links (Cuban links)
Trippin' with Trippie, I came in a mink (Trippin')
We out in public, they flashing the cameras (Flash)
Look at my diamonds, they wet like a sink (Woosh)
All of my bitches be bad to the bone (To the bone)
And they know I'm a king at the top of the throne (Throne)
Flew out to Spain, they was singing my song
I got that stick and I'm never alone

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I'ma hop out with that MAC-10 (I'ma hop out with that MAC-10)
Pussy get shot for that cappin' (Yeah)
Pussy get popped 'bout that actin' (Pussy get popped 'bout that)
Please say hello to my gat, bitch (Please say hello to my)
I'ma slime his ass, bro, on my slatt shit (Slatt shit)
Bitch not my blood on my blatt shit (Blatt shit)
I'm from 800 block where we whack shit (Whack shit)
If I want it, I take that, we snatch shit (Snatch shit)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Niggas know that I'm slime, I get slimy as ever
I got what I got and I got it together
We got some problems, we poppin' wherever
The big homie can't even squash it, I'm telling 'ya
If I get your shit, I ain't gon' post it, I'm selling it
Go to my show, put on drip like I'm dealing it
Shout out my young niggas, swear they be killing shit
Sippin' codeine, that shit give me energy
I'm from 400 block where we still trappin'
Niggas know that we gangbang and still active
We walk down with them sticks like we drill masters
Got them MACs in the Range, we gon' kill Casper
And I hop out with that shit on me (Shit on me)
They treat the kid like I'm big homie
Shoutout to Blood, he know that I'm cuz
But he know that I keep that trip on me
Baby (Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I'ma hop out with that MAC-10 (I'ma hop out with that MAC-10)
Pussy get shot for that cappin' (Yeah)
Pussy get popped 'bout that actin' (Pussy get popped 'bout that)
Please say hello to my gat, bitch (Please say hello to my)
I'ma slime his ass, bro, on my slatt shit (Slatt shit)
Bitch not my blood on my blatt shit (Blatt shit)
I'm from 800 block where we whack shit (Whack shit)
If I want it, I take that, we snatch shit (Snatch shit)
