[Verse 1]
Can you feel it? Now it's coming back
We can steal it if we bridge this gap
I can see you through the curtains of the waterfall

When I lost it, yeah, you held my hand
But I tossed it, didn't understand
You were waiting as I dove into the waterfall

[Chorus]
So say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

So say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel my love? Bombs away!
Bombs away! Bombs away!
Can you feel my love? Bombs away!
Bombs away! Bombs away!
Say Geronimo!

[Verse 2]
Well we rushed it, moving way too fast
That we crushed it, but it's in the past
We can make this leap through the curtains of the waterfall

[Chorus]
So say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel my love? Bombs away!
Bombs away! Bombs away!
Can you feel my love? Bombs away!
Bombs away! Bombs away!
Say Geronimo!

[Bridge]
Well I'm just a boy with a broken toy
All lost and coy, at the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand, as a broken man
But I've found my friend at the curtains of the waterfall
Now I'm falling down, through the crashing sound
And you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall
And you rushed to me and it sets us free
So I fall to my knees at the curtains of the waterfall

[Chorus]
So Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel my love? Bombs away!
Bombs away! Bombs away!
Can you feel my love? Bombs away!
Bombs away! Bombs away!
Say Geronimo!


[Outro]
Make this leap, make this leap
Make this leap, make this leap
Can you feel my love?
