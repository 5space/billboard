[Verse 1]
Take me 'round the world and back again
As I'm searching for my soul out there
Oh, there's something that I'm wondering (Yeah)
Where I'm going when my story ends

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older (Only getting older)
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older (On my mind all the time)

[Chorus]
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me

[Verse 2]
So I'ma light it up, I'm gettin high (So high)
Ask me how I am, I'm getting by (Getting by by the minute)
But I'm thankful that I'm still alive (Alive)
'Cause there's so much more I'm left to find

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older (Only getting older)
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older (On my mind all the time)

[Chorus]
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me up (Up all night)
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me (Up)
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me up (Up all night)

[Bridge]
On my mind all the time
Keepin' me up all night
On my mind all the time
Keepin' me up all night
On my mind all the time, ah

[Outro]
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
