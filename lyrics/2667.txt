[Verse 1: Lil Jon]
How fast can you shake it?
Put it on a nigga 'til his ass can't take it
How fast can you shake it?
Put it on a nigga 'til his ass can't take it
How fast can you shake it?
Put it on a nigga 'til his ass can't take it

Bend ova, make your knees touch your elbows
Stop playing girl, shake that shit
Stop playing girl, shake that shit

Wiggle that ass make it shake like Jello-o
Wiggle that ass make it shake like Jello-o
Wiggle that ass make it shake like Jello-o
Wiggle that ass make it shake like Jello-o
Wiggle that, Wiggle that, Wiggle that
Wiggle that, Wiggle that, Wiggle that
Wiggle that ass make it shake like Jello-o

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Head baby on the fly ain't shit really
I get pussy so wet that's a free willy
Pussy on the pedestal watch 'em pop a wheelie
Pop, pop, pop bitch feel city
With my Nicki's, Jose Cuervo, trippy
She heartless 'til that dance got no engine
One minute, I'mma gas in it
Twenty more minutes, I'm back up in it
Oh yeah, daddy take you Mrs. T-Raw
Take shots, I don't miss, get faded up in it
A million, get illin' richest nigga in the building (building)
Fuck it, I'mma buy the whole building
Hundred business, hundred business back in it
Hundred business, hundred business back in it
She the business, baby put your back in it

[Hook: Lil Jon]
Bend ova, make your knees touch your elbows
Bend ova, make your knees touch your elbows
Bend ova, make your knees touch your elbows
Bend ova, make your knees touch your elbows

[Verse 4: Lil Jon]
Hands on your knees, bounce that ass like a yoga ball
Hands on your knees, bounce that ass like a yoga ball
Hands on your knees, bounce that ass like a yoga ball
Hands on your knees, bounce that ass like a yoga ball
Hands on your knees, bounce that ass like a yoga ball
Hands on your knees, bounce that ass like a yoga ball
Hands on your knees, bounce that ass like a yoga ball

[Outro: Lil Jon]
Bend ova, make your knees touch your elbows
Bend ova, make your knees touch your elbows
