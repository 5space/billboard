[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]
DJ turn me up, crank it to the max
I got lots of gwalla, I be blowing stacks
Polo on my ass, shoes and shirt to match
I be so turnt up, I be swagging to the max
If you get it in, and you getting dough
Gon' pop a bottle if this right here your song
Purple by the zone, you can smell it on my clothes
And it went up in my Swisher, 'bout to take one to the dome
I'm gone, in another zone
I be riding on the engine with the woofers goin' strong
They like, "What is goin' on?" I don't really know
Then I roll down all my windows and I crank this shit some mo'
I'm gone

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Hopped up out the bed, what's happenin'?
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, they can't turn up to my level man
Yeah, money on the table
All up in Mexico, gettin' to the peso
Whoa, check out the gear
If gettin' money was a sport, I'm MVP every year
We get money over here, they must not know where I'm from
Your girl spinnin' on my dick just like a CD-Rom
T-t-turn up, turn up 'til you can't turn no' mo'
Burn up 'til you can't burn no' mo', rock my chain everywhere I go
Smoke 'til you can't smoke no' mo', choke 'til you can't choke no' mo'
Work 'til you can't work no' mo', I'm rich, I can't go broke no' mo'

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
Turn up, all I know is turn up
Smoking like a hippie, I swear all I do is burn up
All in V.I.P and they be acting like they know us
I'm like, "Free turn up, excuse me while I turn up"
All these hoes be chosin' but I turnt up on them hoes
They way I turnt up on the road, I be turned up 'round the globe
All these niggas mad cause I be pulling all they hoes
Once I get 'em to the room, they be turnt up out they clothes like
And I be goin' H.A.M
I don't think these niggas really know just who I am
Bitch it's R-O-S-C-O-E Dash and I get lots of cash
But for short, you can call me Mr. Way-Too-Turnt-Up-For-That-Ass
And I'm gone

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
And shawty we all the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
And shawty we all the way turnt up (Okay) all the way turnt up (Okay)
