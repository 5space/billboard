[KURT]
It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes it's toll
But listen closely

[QUINN]
Not for very much longer

[KURT]
I've got to keep control

[FINN]
I remember doing the Time Warp
Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me

[FINN with QUINN]
And the void would be calling

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

[ARTIE]
It's just a jump to the left

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
And then a step to the right

[ARTIE]
Put your hands on your hips

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
And bring your knees in tight
But it's a pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

[QUINN]
It's so dreamy
Oh, fantasy, free me
So you can't see me
No, not at all

In another dimension
With voyeuristic intentions
Well secluded
Oh, I'll see it all

[KURT]
With a bit of a mind flip

[QUINN]
You're into the time slip

[KURT]
And nothing can ever be the same

[SANTANA (QUINN in the episode version)]
You're spaced out on sensation, ow

[FINN]
Like you're under sedation

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

[BRITTANY]
Well, I was walking down the street
Just a-having a think
When a snake of a guy
Gave me an evil wink

[TINA]
He shook-a me up
He took me by surprise
He had a pickup truck
And the devil's eyes
He stared at me and I felt a change
Time meant nothing, never would again

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

[ARTIE]
It's just a jump to the left

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
And then a step to the right

[ARTIE]
Put your hands on your hips

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
And bring your knees in tight
But it's a pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane

[MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again
