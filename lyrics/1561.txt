[BRITTANY & SANTANA]
Aaaaaaah, aaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaah, aaaaaaaaaah

[RACHEL with BRITTANY & SANTANA Harmonizing]
Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gonna get married

[RACHEL]
Just you wait and see

[PUCK]
Every night, the same old dream, I hate to close my eyes
I can't erase the memory
The sound of Julie's cry
She called me up, late that night
She said, "Joe, don't come over"
My Dad and I just had a fight
And he stormed out the door
I've never seen him act this way
My God, he's going crazy

[PUCK with with BRITTANY & SANTANA Harmonizing]
He said he's gonna make you pay
For what we've done, he's got a gun

[PUCK with BRITTANY & SANTANA]
So run, Joey run, Joey run!

[RACHEL with BRITTANY & SANTANA Harmonizing]
Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gonna get married

[RACHEL]
Just you wait and see

[JESSE, (RACHEL)]
Got in my car, drove like mad
'Til I reached Julie's place
She ran to me, with tear-filled eyes
And bruises on her face
All at once I saw him there
Sneakin' up behind me (Watch out!)
Then Julie yelled, "He's got a gun!"

[FINN]
And she stepped in front of me
Then, suddenly, a shot rang out
And I saw Julie falling

[FINN with BRITTANY & SANTANA Harmonizing]
I ran to her; I held her close
When I looked down, my hands were red!

[FINN]
And here's the last words Julie said:

[RACHEL]
Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gonna get married.....

[BRITTANY & SANTANA]
Aaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaah

[JESSE with BRITTANY & SANTANA]
Run, Joey, run, Joey, run

[FINN with BRITTANY & SANTANA]
Joey, run

[PUCK with BRITTANY & SANTANA]
Joey, run

[FINN, JESSE, & Puck with BRITTANY & SANTANA Harmonizing]
Joey, run, Joey, run...
