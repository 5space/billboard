[Intro]
Whoa, nobody's home, I'm all alone
Guess I'll just sit here and stare at my phone
When I'm all alone, you don't even know
How bad I'd love to be alone with you

[Verse 1]
And I could go, put on a hoodie and sweats
And then take a walk to coffee, and get back into bed
But my bed and my head and the heart that you wrecked
In my chest are a mess since the second you left
And I'm lying awake and impatiently pacing
The hallways and taking the pictures from frames
And arrangements of daisies in vases you made
Are all dead and alone, like I am but I hope that

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'll forget you someday
But today is just another Monday

[Chorus]
So, nobody's home, I'm all alone
Guess it's just whiskey, weed, me and my phone
I'm on my own, I didn't know
I don't like this feeling at
All that I know is I'm lonely here in my room (In my room, yeah)
And all that I need is somebody who's lonely too
I'd love to be alone with

[Verse 2]
You and I were king and queen of quiet nights in
We'd order food and watch a movie and then do it again
But now the castle that we built is just a spot we split rent
And now it's slowly sinking in that I don't have many friends
But when I sleep at night, I dream that we is you and I
And when I wake, I'm paralyzed, the bed is frozen on your side
Been sleeping sideways, inside for five days
Been asking my brain who's waking up at your place

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope I forgive you someday
But today is just another Monday

[Chorus]
So, nobody's home, I'm all alone
Guess it's just whiskey, weed, me and my phone
I'm on my own, I didn't know
I don't like this feeling at
All that I know is I'm lonely here in my room (In my room, yeah)
And all that I need is somebody who's lonely too
I'd love to be alone with you, you, you
I'd love to be alone with you, with you, with you
I'd love to be alone with

[Bridge]
I know that I've got a couple of voids I could fill
I promise you, one day I will
But if I can avoid them now, Lord knows, I will
Maybe I'll forget you someday
Hey, baby, maybe one day
Or maybe after Sunday

[Chorus]
When nobody's home, I'm all alone
Guess it's just whiskey, weed, me and my phone
I'm on my own, I didn't know
I don't like this feeling at
All that I know is I'm lonely here in my room, yeah
And all that I need is somebody who's lonely too
I'd love to be alone with you, you, you
All that I know is, I'd love to be alone with you
I'd love to be alone with you, you, you
I'll be going crazy, patient waiting, baby, when you coming through?
I'd love to be alone with you
