[BRITTANY]
Baby, can't you see I'm callin'?
A guy like you should wear a warnin'
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'

[RACHEL & BRITTANY]
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

[WILL]
Too high, can't come down
Losin' my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Oh, do you feel me now?

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

[WILL]
(Na na na)

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?

[WILL]
(Oh, na, oh)

[BRITTANY, RACHEL & WILL]
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's takin' over me

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Ah

[WILL]
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Oh, can you feel me now? (Oh!)

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

[WILL & SANTANA]
(na na na, yeah!)

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[WILL & SANTANA]

[WILL & SANTANA]
(I'm slippin' under)

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
With a taste of a poison paradise

[WILL & SANTANA]
('Cause I know that you're toxic)

[NEW DIRECTIONS]

[SANTANA]
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
