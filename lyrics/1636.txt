[FINN]
I don't like cities
But I like New York

[SANTANA]
The famous places to visit are so many

[FINN]
Other places
Make me feel like a dork

[SANTANA]
I told my grandpa I wouldn't miss on any

[ARTIE]
Los Angeles is for
People who sleep

[MERCEDES]
Got to see the whole town right from Yonkers on down to the Bay

[ARTIE]
Paris and London
Oh baby you can keep

[SANTANA]
Baby you can keep

[MERCEDES]
Baby you can keep

[FINN & RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS (NEW DIRECTIONS)]
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York, New York
It's a wonderful town (New York)

[ARTIE with NEW DIRECTIONS]
I love New York

[ARTIE & MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS, (NEW DIRECTIONS)]
I love New York (New York, New York)
I love New York (New York, New York)
New York, New York

[FINN]
If you don't like my attitude
Then you can get lost

[SANTANA (with NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS)]
(Manhattan women) Are dressed in silk and satin

[FINN (with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS)]
(Just go to Texas) Isn't that where they golf?

[SANTANA (with NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS)]
(There's just one thing that's) important in Manhattan

[ARTIE]
New York is not for little wussies who scream

[NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS]
AAAHHH!

[MERCEDES]
Pick up a date
Maybe seven or eight

[ARTIE]
Paris and London
Oh baby, you can keep

[MERCEDES with SANTANA]
Baby, you can keep

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Baby, you can keep!

[FINN & RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS (NEW DIRECTIONS), {MERCEDES}]
Other cities always make me mad {Make me mad}
Other places always make me sad {Make me mad}
No other city ever made me glad

[BRITTANY with NEW DIRECTIONS GIRLS]
We've sailed the seas
And we've been the world over
Made the Mandalay
We've seen the Sphinx
And we've seen the Cliffs of Dover
And we can safely say

[RACHEL]
New York!

[FINN & RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS, (MERCEDES)]
Other cities always make me mad (Ow!)
Other places always make me sad (New York!)
No other city ever made me glad except New York, New York
It's a wonderful town (New York)
