[Click here to read about the first time Blake drank sangria]

[Verse 1]
You're crashin' into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you to stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We've got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Tryin' to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria

[Verse 2]
Wreckin' ball dancin' down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria

[Bridge]
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around
