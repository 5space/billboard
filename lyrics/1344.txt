[Verse 1]
This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped up cars, water towers
Or drowning in a bottle of Jack
This ain't about Chevys
Ain't about money
Ain't about blue suede shoes, coo-coo-ca-choos
Got nothing to do with that

[Chorus]
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen
Rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Oh, blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl

[Verse 2]
Ah, it's a song about you, oh, yeah
This ain't about hometowns
Ain't about back roads
Ain't about shoulda, coulda, wish I woulda
Rear views looking back
This ain't about goodbyes
Ain't about come-backs
Oh, got nothing to do with the stars and the moon
Man, you're getting way off track

[Chorus]
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen
Rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Oh, blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl

[Bridge]
Baby you, yeah you, yeah you, know who you are
Baby you, yeah you, read my lips, hear my heart
Listen to this guitar

[Chorus]
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen
Rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
Every time
Oh, don't think too hard
Dig too deep
Or read between the lines

[Chorus]
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen
Rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Oh, blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl, girl, oh
It's a song about a girl, girl, ohh, yeah
It's a song about a girl, girl, oh
It's a song about a girl

[Outro]
This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped up cars, water towers
Or drowning in a bottle of Jack
