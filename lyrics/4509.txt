[Intro]
Stop! The train is riding
Down to the station
Where you lived
When we were school kids

[Verse 1]
Hey! The rails are caught now
And I am falling down
Fools in a spiral
Round this town of steel

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more

[Verse 2]
Stop! The train is riding
Down to the station
Where I lived
When I was a cool kid

[Verse 3]
Hey! Is it my fault that
The fallen embers burn
Down in a spiral
Round your crown of thieves?

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more
It rides out of town

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Oh, it's my road
It's my road, it's my road
It's my road
It's my road, it's my war
It's my war
It's my war, it's my war
His eyes are open
His eyes are open
Oh, 'cause I want more
I want more, want more
His eyes are open
His eyes are open
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more
It rides out of town
