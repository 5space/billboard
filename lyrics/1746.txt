[Verse 1]
Barbed wire fence carving out a hillside
Cutting holes in the midday sun
Like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust
I love the rhythm of an old grey blacktop, 33's just whistling by
Steer the wheel, one handed on a two lane, hugging that line
I got the windows down, no one else around singing

[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
Come on, come on sing along, sing along to my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
I hit the brakes for an old New Holland, hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay field's just been cut
I got the windows down, way out of town singing…

[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3]
The only way today could get better, girl what I'm thinking
Is I can pick you up, you slide in this truck
And I can hear you singing

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Let me hear you sing it
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles we're rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song

This is my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
This is my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
Come on, come on, sing along
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
To my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
