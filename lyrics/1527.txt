[Intro]
Yeah, ayy, uh
I do this shit 'cause I-
Turn, turn it up a little bit
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta blap
Yo, yo, yo, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
I might go fuck up these bands (Ayy)
I do this shit 'cause I can (Yeah)
I just took care of my fam (Ayy)
Thought this was always the plan (Yeah)
I might go fly to Japan (Ayy)
Honolulu, get a tan (Yeah)
To the beach I don't bring sand (No)
Thought that was always the plan (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Growed up, now I am the man (Yeah)
It's shit you don't understand (Ayy)
Popeye just opened the can
I don't fuck with no fufu that's not on my brand (Ayy)
Call me when you need a hand (Yeah)
In the Bay, I'm Superman (Ayy)
YSL on me, goddamn
Tell me, why is your girlfriend my number one fan? (Yeah)
Always scrutinized
Bags are supersized, why are you surprised?
Must have mixed us with a different group of guys
Spot the truth or lies, I mean business but I'm not in suit and ties
Just been prophesized (Yeah, uh)
This shit fell right into place (Yeah)
Indy 500 my pace (Ayy)
Drinking it straight to the face
Liquor and women, two things I don't chase (Uh)
Don't got a minute to waste (Yeah)
Mask off, I'm showing my face (Yeah)
Shout-out Dakari, my ace (Uh)
They hate so much, it's a disgrace (Uh)
I put 'em back into place (Yeah)
I put your bitch in a Wraith
I just snatch her, she's vanishing without a trace (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I might go fuck up these bands (Ayy)
I do this shit 'cause I can (Yeah)
I just took care of my fam (Ayy)
Thought this was always the plan (Yeah)
I might go fly to Japan (Ayy)
Honolulu, get a tan (Yeah)
To the beach I don't bring sand (No)
Thought that was always the plan (No)

[Chorus]
Thought that was always the plan (No)
Thought that was always the plan (Ayy)
Did it, I do it again (No)
Thought that was always the plan
I might go fuck up these bands (Ayy)
I do this shit 'cause I can (Yeah)
I just took care of my fam (Ayy)
Thought this was always the plan (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Ten years, this shit has been brewing (Ayy)
I'm like "The fuck you been doing?" (Yeah)
Hall of Fame, Gerald's a shoe in
You'll never be Jordan, you're more Patrick Ewing (Yeah)
Number one spot, I'm pursuing (Ayy)
Exclusive like "Who done let you in?"
Money talks, I speak it fluent
Got tired of my bitch, I went got a new one
Quick swish that, this bitch whack
Pack, flip that, making quick stacks
This shit blap, G did that (Uh)
Taking a quick trap nap (Yeah)
I go all night and shit, ain't gotta hide this shit
This shit's a freestyle, I ain't even write this shit
Roll me some Marty and Iâ€™m finna light this shit (Ayy, yeah)
They finna bite this shit, ayy (Yeah)
Like Jaws swimming on South Beach, this is shit that they don't teach
Don't go too far, don't try too hard, bitch, don't reach like (Uh)
Drugs got me on a level, lockjaw, I got slow speech
I'm courtside, I got floor seats next to Rihanna like "Oh sheesh!"

[Pre-Chorus]
I might go fuck up these bands (Ayy)
I do this shit 'cause I can (Yeah)
I just took care of my fam (ayy)
Thought this was always the plan (Yeah)
I might go fly to Japan (Ayy)
Honolulu, get a tan (Yeah)
To the beach I don't bring sand (No)
Thought that was always the plan (No)

[Chorus]
Thought that was always the plan (No)
Thought that was always the plan (Ayy)
Did it, I do it again (No)
Thought that was always the plan
I might go fuck up these bands (Ayy)
I do this shit cause I can (Yeah)
I just took care of my fam (Ayy)
Thought this was always the plan (Yeah)

[Outro]
I thought this was always the plan
What were you doing? What do you mean?
There's only one way, there's only one option
There's only one route to get there, you know?
It's not gon' make itself
When you wake up and check the Chase app
And this shit got more and more digits than a license plate
Them seven-eight figures don't make themselves, yadadamean?
You gotta get it! This was always the plan
