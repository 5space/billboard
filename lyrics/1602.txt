[TINA]
Happiness hit her
Like a train on a track

[MERCEDES]
Coming towards her
Stuck still, no turning back

[TINA]
She hid around corners
And she hid under beds

[MERCEDES]
She killed it with kisses
And from it she fled

[TINA]
With every bubble
She sank with a drink

[MERCEDES]
And washed it away
Down the kitchen sink

[TINA]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are comin'
So you better run

[MERCEDES & TINA with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and your brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over, the dog days are done
Can you hear the horses? 'Cause here they come!

[TINA]
And I never wanted
Anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too
Oh

[MERCEDES, TINA & NEW DIRECTIONS]
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

[MERCEDES & TINA]
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and your brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you, if you want to survive

[MERCEDES & TINA with NEW DIRECTIONS]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come!

[NEW DIRECTIONS (MERCEDES, TINA & NEW DIRECTIONS)]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done (Here they come!)
The horses are comin', so you'd better run (Here they come!)
The dog days and over
The dog days are done (Here they come!)
The horses are comin', so you'd better run
