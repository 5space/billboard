Uh
Baby, I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume
The make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Mad as you are, you stick around
And I just don't know why

[NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS (Artie)]
If I was ya' man (Baby, you)
Never worry 'bout (What I do)
I'd be coming home (Back to you)

[ARTIE]
Every night
Doin' you right

[NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS & (Artie)]
You're the type of woman (Deserves good thangs)
Fist full of diamonds (Hand full of rings)
Baby, you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)

[ARTIE with NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be

[ARTIE]
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
Yeah

Listen
Your true beauty's description
Looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control
Baby, you know

[NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS & (Artie)]
If I was ya' man (Baby, you)
Never worry 'bout (What I do)
I'd be coming home (Back to you)

[ARTIE]
Every night doin' you right

[NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS & (Artie)]
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
