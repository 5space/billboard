[RACHEL]
Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

[RACHEL & PUCK]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

[RACHEL]
For me it happens all the time

[RACHEL & PUCK]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone, and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control, and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

[PUCK]
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

[RACHEL & PUCK]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

[PUCK]
For me it happens all the time

[RACHEL & PUCK]
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk, and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control, and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

[PUCK]
Whoa

[RACHEL]
Whoa...

[RACHEL & PUCK]
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

[RACHEL]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone, and I need you now

[PUCK]
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk, and I need you now

[RACHEL & PUCK]
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

[RACHEL]
Oh baby, I need you now
