[Verse:]
When the roll is called up yonder
I hope you see me there
It's in the water, it's where you came from
It's in the water, it's where you came from
When the crowd begins to wonder
And they cry to see your face

[Chorus:]
It's in the water, it's in the story, of where you came from
Your sons and daughters, in all their glory, it's going to shape her
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

[Bridge:]
So the roll it was called from yonder
Never sold yourself away

[Chorus:]
It's in the water, it's in the story, of where you came from
Your sons and daughters, in all their glory, it's going to shape her
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

[Outro:]
It's in the water, it's where you came from
It's in the water, it's where you came from
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water, where you came from, where you came from
